Maybe discuss here the shortage of information around the world: Burke et al.,

## Remote sensing

TO DO:

-   Add some background information

-   suggestions for interesting features

-   explain features (bands etc)

## Modeling approaches

Simple models possible however because of the nature of RS data...

indexes: computed from imagery: proportions of different wave lengths examples of non machine learning approaches: crop_5

### Machine Learning

Machine Learning is

why its needed in remote sensing?

types of machine learning:

possible grouping
