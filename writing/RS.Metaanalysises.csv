While previous review papers in this domain have been conﬁned to 2020, an up-to-date review to show the progression of research extending into the present phase is lacking. In this review, we explore the recent articles, providing a thorough classiﬁcation of approaches into three main categories: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, Vision Transformer (ViT)-based, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based architectures. Notably, within the CNN-based category, we further reﬁne the classiﬁcation based on speciﬁc methodologies and techniques employed. In addition, a novel and rigorous meta-analysis is performed to synthesize and analyze the ﬁndings from 50 peer-reviewed journal articles to provide valuable insights in this domain, surpassing the scope of existing review articles. Our meta-analysis shows that the most adopted remote sensing scene datasets are AID (41 articles) and NWPU-RESISC45 (40). A notable paradigm shift is seen towards the use of transformer-based models (6) starting from 2021. Furthermore, we critically discuss the ﬁndings from the review and meta-analysis, identifying challenges and future opportunities for improvement in this domain. Our up-to-date study serves as an invaluable resource for researchers seeking to contribute to this growing area of research.","2023-10-02","2023-11-22 12:12:57","2023-11-22 12:12:57","2023-11-22 12:12:57","4804","","19","15","","Remote Sensing","Deep Learning for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/5BAYLRLZ/Thapa et al. - 2023 - Deep Learning for Remote Sensing Image Scene Class.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the history of ML is important both for understanding current trends and predicting future applications. The 1950s saw the first idea of ML with the Turing Test, which was described as a ‘learning machine’ that could acquire information and become artificially intelligent. This thought prevailed until the 1960s with the release of Perceptron I, which caused a shift to attempt to code computers to learn from input data in order to run like a human brain. The 1980s and 1990s saw the advancement of computing technologies which enabled ML within artificial intelligence to prosper. The development of artificial neural networks during this time shifted ML from a knowledge‐driven approach to a data‐driven one. The 2000s saw ML becoming more widespread within geography and other disciplines as unsupervised methods enabled the analysis of large data sets. More recently, deep learning emerged to enable processes to be integrated into many software services and applications. Present day ML has been defined by Stanford University (2017) as “the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed”. Academic research alongside industry and government investments in ML now account for some of the most important technological advancements. The use of ML within geography has been increasing at a rapid rate paving the way for future advancements in the discipline.","2021-05","2023-11-22 12:13:09","2023-11-22 12:13:09","2023-11-22 12:13:09","e12563","","5","15","","Geography Compass","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/G5HT9FVR/Lavallin and Downs - 2021 - Machine learning in geography–Past, present, and f.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous studies conducted over several decades have investigated a broad array of input data and classification methods. However, this vast assemblage of research results has not been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the relative performance of different classification processes for generating land cover products. To address this problem, we completed a statistical meta-analysis of the past 15years of research on supervised per-pixel image classification published in five high-impact remote sensing journals. The two general factors evaluated were classification algorithms and input data manipulation as these are factors that can be controlled by analysts to improve classification accuracy. The meta-analysis revealed that inclusion of texture information yielded the greatest improvement in overall accuracy of land-cover classification with an average increase of 12.1%. This increase in accuracy can be attributed to the additional spatial context information provided by including texture. Inclusion of ancillary data, multi-angle and time images also provided significant improvement in classification overall accuracy, with 8.5%, 8.0%, and 6.9% of average improvements, respectively. In contrast, other manipulation of spectral information such as index creation (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and feature extraction (e.g. Principal Components Analysis) offered much smaller improvements in accuracy. In terms of classification algorithms, support vector machines achieved the greatest accuracy, followed by neural network methods. The random forest classifier performed considerably better than the traditional decision tree classifier. Maximum likelihood classifiers, often used as benchmarking algorithms, offered low accuracy. Our findings will help guide practitioners to decide which classification to implement and also provide direction to researchers regarding comparative studies that will further solidify our understanding of different classification processes. However, these general guidelines do not preclude an analyst from incorporating personal preferences or considering specific algorithmic benefits that may be pertinent to a particular application.","2016-05-01","2023-11-22 12:17:59","2023-11-22 12:17:59","2023-11-22 12:17:59","89-100","","","177","","Remote Sensing of Environment","A meta-analysis of remote sensing research on supervised pixel-based land-cover image classification processes","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/HM5D5A2Z/Khatami et al. - 2016 - A meta-analysis of remote sensing research on supe.pdf; /Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/UBG72C56/S0034425716300578.html","","","Classification accuracy; Environmental monitoring; Indices; Land cover mapping; Machine learning; Multi-time/angle imagery; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Texture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last few decades, a growing number of wetland studies employed remote sensing (RS) to scientifically monitor the status of wetlands and support their sustainability. Considering the rapid evolution of wetland studies and significant progress that has been made in the field, this paper constitutes an overview of studies utilizing RS methods in wetland monitoring. It investigates publications from 1990 up to the middle of 2022, providing a systematic survey on RS data type, machine learning (ML) tools, publication details (e.g., authors, affiliations, citations, and publications date), case studies, accuracy metrics, and other parameters of interest for RS-based wetland studies by covering 344 papers. The RS data and ML combination is deemed helpful for wetland monitoring and multi-proxy studies, and it may open up new perspectives for research studies. In a rapidly changing wetlands landscape, integrating multiple RS data types and ML algorithms is an opportunity to advance science support for management decisions. This paper provides insight into the selection of suitable ML and RS data types for the detailed monitoring of wetland-associated systems. The synthesized findings of this paper are essential to determining best practices for environmental management, restoration, and conservation of wetlands. This meta-analysis establishes avenues for future research and outlines a baseline framework to facilitate further scientific research using the latest state-of-art ML tools for processing RS data. Overall, the present work recommends that wetland sustainability requires a special land-use policy and relevant protocols, regulation, and/or legislation.","2022-01","2023-11-22 12:42:45","2023-11-22 12:42:45","2023-11-22 12:42:45","6104","","23","14","","","Remote Sensing and Machine Learning Tools to Support Wetland Monitoring","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 23 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/TSJC6THN/Jafarzadeh et al. - 2022 - Remote Sensing and Machine Learning Tools to Suppo.pdf","","","machine learning; meta-analysis; remote sensing; systematic review; wetlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prediction models such as empirical or data-driven models play a fundamental role in forecasting drought. However, selecting a suitable prediction model remains a challenge because of the lack of succinct information available on model performance. Therefore, this review evaluated the best model for drought forecasting and determined which differences if any were present in model performance using standardised precipitation index (SPI). In addition, the most effective combination of the SPI with its respective timescale and lead time was investigated. The effectiveness of data-driven models was analysed using meta-regression analysis by applying a linear mixed model to the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error of the validated model results. Wavelet-transformed neural networks had superior performance with the highest correlation and minimum error. Preprocessing data to eliminate non-stationarity performed substantially better than did the regular artificial neural network (ANN) model. Additionally, the best timescale to calculate the SPI was 24 and 12 months and a lead time of 1–3 months provided the most accurate forecasts. Studies from China and Sicily had the most variation based on geographical location as a random effect; while studies from India rendered consistent results overall. Variation in the result can be attributed to geographical differences, seasonal influence, incorporation of climate indices and author bias. Conclusively, this review recommends use of the wavelet-based ANN (WANN) model to forecast drought indices.","2019-06-01","2023-11-22 15:05:19","2023-11-22 15:05:23","2023-11-22 15:05:19","955-977","","2","97","","Nat Hazards","Drought forecasting through statistical models using standardised precipitation index","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/KMR7FPKP/Anshuka et al. - 2019 - Drought forecasting through statistical models usi.pdf","","","Drought forecasting; Meta-regression analysis; Model performance; Standardised precipitation index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study focused mainly on three fundamental aspects, namely descriptive modelling, predictive modelling, and spatial modelling of expected risks and vulnerability to drought. Thus, out of 417 articles across all studies on drought, 226 articles published from 2010 to 2022 were analyzed to provide a global overview of the current state of knowledge on multivariate drought modelling using the inclusion criteria. The main objective is to review the recent available scientific evidence regarding multivariate drought modelling based on the joint use of geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence. The analysis focused on the different methods used, the choice of algorithms and the most relevant variables depending on whether they are descriptive or predictive models. Criteria such as the skill score, the given game complexity used, and the nature of validation data were considered to draw the main conclusions. The results highlight the very heterogeneous nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought, and the very original nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought in the recent literature. For future studies, in addition to scientific advances in prospects, case studies and comparative studies appear necessary for an in-depth analysis of the reproducibility and operational applicability of the different approaches proposed for spatial and temporal modelling of agricultural drought. HIGHLIGHTSThe components and fundamentals of multivariate modelling of agricultural drought were discussed.The importance of hybrid artificial intelligence models is widely discussed in improving the performance of traditional machine learning models.Quantum machine learning algorithms are weakly explored in multivariate drought modelling. Therefore, future studies should explore this approach.The major challenge of multivariate modelling of drought frequency is mainly related to the difference in the return periods of the different variables (time-shifted and spatially effects).","2022-12-31","2023-11-22 15:07:20","2023-11-22 15:07:20","2023-11-22 15:07:20","2737-2776","","1","13","","","Modelling agricultural drought","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/19475705.2022.2131471","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/JE2UBV7E/Hanadé Houmma et al. - 2022 - Modelling agricultural drought a review of latest.pdf","","","machine learning; agricultural drought indices; artificial intelligence; drought frequency; Multi-sensor modelling; multivariate drought modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we statistically analyse the literature in the expanding field of welfare and poverty predictions from the combination of machine learning and satellite imagery. Here, we apply an integrative review method to extract key data on factors related to the predictive power of welfare. We found that the most important factors correlated to the predictive power of welfare are the number of pre‐processing steps employed, the number of datasets used, the type of welfare indicator targeted and the choice of AI model. Studies that used stock measure indicators (assets) as targets achieved better performance—17 percentage points higher—in predicting welfare than those that targeted flow measures (income and consumption) ones. Additionally, we found that the combination of machine learning and deep learning significantly increases predictive power—by as much as 15 percentage points—compared to using either alone. Surprisingly, we found that the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery used is important but not critical to the performance as the relationship is positive but not statistically significant.

Burke               et al.               reviewed this recent progress with a particular focus on machine-learning approaches and artificial intelligence methods. Drawing on examples mostly from Africa, they conclude that satellite-based methods enhance rather than replace ground-based data collection, and progress depends on a combined approach.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eabe8628                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Accurate and comprehensive measurements of a range of sustainable development outcomes are fundamental inputs into both research and policy. For instance, good measures are needed to monitor progress toward sustainability goals and evaluate interventions designed to improve development outcomes. Traditional approaches to measurement of many key outcomes rely on household surveys that are conducted infrequently in many parts of the world and are often of low accuracy. The paucity of ground data stands in contrast to the rapidly growing abundance and quality of satellite imagery. Multiple public and private sensors launched in recent years provide temporal, spatial, and spectral information on changes happening on Earth’s surface.               Here we review a rapidly growing scientific literature that seeks to use this satellite imagery to measure and understand various outcomes related to sustainable development. We pay particular attention to recent approaches that use methods from artificial intelligence to extract information from images, as these methods typically outperform earlier approaches and enable new insights. Our focus is on settings and applications where humans themselves, or what they produce, are the outcome of interest and on where these outcomes are being measured using satellite imagery.                                         ADVANCES               We describe and synthesize the variety of approaches that have been used to extract information from satellite imagery, with particular attention given to recent machine learning–based approaches and settings in which training data are limited or noisy. We then quantitatively assess predictive performance of these approaches in the domains of smallholder agriculture, economic livelihoods, population, and informal settlements. We show that satellite-based performance in predicting these outcomes is reasonably strong and improving. Performance improvements have come through a combination of more numerous and accurate training data, more abundant and higher-quality imagery, and creative application of advances in computer vision to satellite inputs and sustainability outcomes. Further, our analyses suggest that reported model performance likely understates true performance in many settings, given the noisy data on which predictions are evaluated and the types of noise typically observed in sustainability applications. For multiple outcomes of interest, satellite-based estimates can now equal or exceed the accuracy of traditional approaches to outcome measurement. We describe multiple methods through which the true performance of satellite-based approaches can be better understood.               Integration of satellite-based sustainability measurements into research has been broad, and we describe applications in agriculture, fisheries, health, and economics. Documented uses of these measurements in public-sector decision-making are rarer, which we attribute in part to the novelty of the approaches, their lack of interpretability, and the potential benefits to some policy-makers of not having certain outcomes be measured.                                         OUTLOOK               The largest constraint to satellite-based model performance is now training data rather than imagery. While imagery has become abundant, the scarcity and frequent unreliability of ground data make both training and validation of satellite-based models difficult. Expanding the quantity and quality of such data will quickly accelerate progress in this field. Other opportunities for advancement include improvements in model interpretability, fusion of satellites with other nontraditional data that provide complementary information, and more-rigorous evaluation of satellite-based approaches (relative to available alternatives) in the context of specific use cases.               Nevertheless, despite the current and future promise of satellite-based approaches, we argue that these approaches will amplify rather than replace existing ground-based data collection efforts in most settings. Many outcomes of interest will likely never be accurately estimated with satellites; for outcomes where satellites do have predictive power, high-quality local training data can nearly always improve model performance.                                                   Increasing collection of satellite imagery can help measure livelihood outcomes in areas where ground data are sparse.                                        (Left) Interval between nationally representative economic surveys over the past three decades shows long lags in many developing countries.

We synthesize the growing literature that uses satellite imagery to understand these outcomes, with a focus on approaches that combine imagery with machine learning. We quantify the paucity of ground data on key human-related outcomes and the growing abundance and improving resolution (spatial, temporal, and spectral) of satellite imagery. We then review recent machine learning approaches to model-building in the context of scarce and noisy training data, highlighting how this noise often leads to incorrect assessment of model performance.

The consistent pattern observed across peer-reviewed research papers shows an increasing interest in the use of satellites as an innovative approach for monitoring water quality, a critical step towards addressing the challenges posed by rising anthropogenic water pollution. Traditional methods of monitoring water quality have limitations, but satellite sensors provide a potential solution to that by lowering costs and expanding temporal and spatial coverage. However, conventional statistical methods are limited when faced with the formidable challenge of conducting pattern recognition analysis for satellite geospatial big data because they are characterized by high volume and complexity. As a compelling alternative, the application of machine and deep learning techniques has emerged as an indispensable tool, with the remarkable capability to discern intricate patterns in the data that might otherwise remain elusive to traditional statistics. The study employed a targeted search strategy, utilizing specific criteria and the titles of 332 peer-reviewed journal articles indexed in Scopus, resulting in the inclusion of 165 articles for the meta-analysis. Our comprehensive bibliometric analysis provides insights into the trends, research productivity, and impact of satellite-based water quality monitoring. It highlights key journals and publishers in this domain while examining the relationship between the first author’s presentation, publication year, citation count, and journal impact factor. The major review findings highlight the widespread use of satellite sensors in water quality monitoring including the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Operational Land Imager (OLI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and the practice of multi-sensor data fusion. Deep neural networks are identified as popular and high-performing algorithms, with significant competition from extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), even though XGBoost is relatively newer in the field of machine learning. Chlorophyll-a and water clarity indicators receive special attention, and geo-location had a relationship with optical water classes. This paper contributes significantly by providing extensive examples and in-depth discussions of papers with code, as well as highlighting the critical cyber infrastructure used in this research. Advances in high-performance computing, large-scale data processing capabilities, and the availability of open-source software are facilitating the growing prominence of machine and deep learning applications in geospatial artificial intelligence for water quality monitoring, and this is positively contributing towards monitoring water pollution.","2023-10","2024-03-23 11:07:25","2024-03-23 11:07:25","2024-03-23 11:07:25","170","","10","10","","","Meta-Analysis of Satellite Observations for United Nations Sustainable Development Goals","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 10 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/E79E6RBX/Mukonza and Chiang - 2023 - Meta-Analysis of Satellite Observations for United.pdf","","","machine learning; deep learning; water pollution; freshwater; satellites; water quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With this in mind, we reviewed the literature on statistical machine learning methods commonly applied to remote sensing data. We focus particularly on applications related to the United Nations World Bank Sustainable Development Goals, including agriculture (food security), forests (life on land), and water (water quality). We provide a review of useful statistical machine learning methods, how they work in a remote sensing context, and examples of their application to these types of data in the literature. Rather than prescribing particular methods for specific applications, we provide guidance, examples, and case studies from the literature for the remote sensing practitioner and applied statistician. In the supplementary material, we also describe the necessary steps pre and post analysis for remote sensing data; the pre-processing and evaluation steps.","2018-09","2024-03-23 11:23:25","2024-03-23 11:23:25","2024-03-23 11:23:25","1365","","9","10","","","Statistical Machine Learning Methods and Remote Sensing for Sustainable Development Goals","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 9 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/TIG8588H/Holloway and Mengersen - 2018 - Statistical Machine Learning Methods and Remote Se.pdf","","","machine learning; remote sensing; agriculture; sustainable development; big data; satellite imagery; statistical methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, machine learning algorithms have been applied to UAV-based remote sensing data for enhancing the UAV capabilities of various applications. This systematic review was performed on studies through a statistical meta-analysis of UAV applications along with machine learning algorithms in agro-environmental monitoring. For this purpose, a total number of 163 peer-reviewed articles published in 13 high-impact remote sensing journals over the past 20 years were reviewed focusing on several features, including study area, application, sensor type, platform type, and spatial resolution. The meta-analysis revealed that 62% and 38% of the studies applied regression and classification models, respectively. Visible sensor technology was the most frequently used sensor with the highest overall accuracy among classification articles. Regarding regression models, linear regression and random forest were the most frequently applied models in UAV remote sensing imagery processing. Finally, the results of this study confirm that applying machine learning approaches on UAV imagery produces fast and reliable results. Agriculture, forestry, and grassland mapping were found as the top three UAV applications in this review, in 42%, 22%, and 8% of the studies, respectively.","2020-01","2024-04-02 07:04:41","2024-04-02 07:04:41","2024-04-02 07:04:41","3511","","21","12","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 21 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/FIZ674HZ/Eskandari et al. - 2020 - Meta-analysis of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Ima.pdf","","","machine learning; remote sensing; classification; regression; agro-environmental monitoring; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many previous studies have combined flux observations and meteorological, biophysical, and ancillary predictors using machine learning to simulate the site-scale NEE. However, systematic evaluation of the performance of such models is limited. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of these NEE simulations. A total of 40 such studies and 178 model records were included. The impacts of various features throughout the modeling process on the accuracy of the model were evaluated. Random forests and support vector machines performed better than other algorithms. Models with larger timescales have lower average R2 values, especially when the timescale exceeds the monthly scale. Half-hourly models (average R2 = 0.73) were significantly more accurate than daily models (average R2 = 0.5). There are significant differences in the predictors used and their impacts on model accuracy for different plant functional types (PFTs). Studies at continental and global scales (average R2 = 0.37) with multiple PFTs, more sites, and a large span of years correspond to lower R2 values than studies at local (average R2 = 0.69) and regional (average R2 = 0.7) scales. Also, the site-scale NEE predictions need more focus on the internal heterogeneity of the NEE dataset and the matching of the training set and validation set.","2022-08-16","2024-04-02 07:06:29","2024-04-02 07:06:29","2024-04-02 07:06:29","3739-3756","","16","19","","","Variability and uncertainty in flux-site-scale net ecosystem exchange simulations based on machine learning and remote sensing","","","","","","","English","","","","","Copernicus Online Journals","","Publisher: Copernicus GmbH","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/Y2PYJJTL/Shi et al. - 2022 - Variability and uncertainty in flux-site-scale net.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
