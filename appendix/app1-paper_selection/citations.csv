(2) the rf model was chosen as the optimal approach for predicting and mapping soil salinity based on performance at four soil depths. (3) the soil salinity profiles exhibited intricate coexistence of two distinct types: surface aggregated and homogeneous. the former was dominant in the east, where salinity was higher. the central and southwestern parts were mostly homogeneous, with lower soil salinity. (4) the soil salinity throughout the four depths examined was found to be most elevated in saltern and bare land and lowest in wetland vegetation and farmland, according to land-cover type. this study proposed a remote sensing prediction method for salinization in multiple soil layers in the coastal plain, which could provide decision support for spatial monitoring of land salinization and achieving land degradation neutrality targets.",2023,16/01/2024 09:03,19/01/2024 10:54,NA,5640,NA,24,15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,Publicly Available Content Database,2904924547,NA,NA,Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG,NA,; ,https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/oYWmW?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=ubpSPT%2BsvQplnr5mTsDWlWZMk64%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Mapping+Multi-Depth+Soil+Salinity+Using+Remote+Sensing-Enabled+Machine+Learning+in+the+Yellow+River+Delta%2C+China&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=24&spage=5640&au=Zhang%2C+Haoran%3BFu%2C+Xin%3BZhang%2C+Yanna%3BZhaishuo+Qi%3BZhang%2C+Hengcai%3BXu%2C+Zhenghe&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15245640,Agricultural land; Artificial neural networks; Back propagation networks; China; Coastal plains; Coasts; Coexistence; Correlation analysis; Decision trees; Degradation; Electrical conductivity; Electrical resistivity; Inversion; Land cover; Land degradation; Land use; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Mapping; Neural networks; Physics; Precipitation; Prediction models; Remote sensing; Research methodology; Rivers; Salinity; Salinity effects; Salinization; Salt; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Soil analysis; Soil depth; soil layer; Soil layers; Soil mapping; Soil salinity; soil salinization; spatial distribution; Spatial distribution; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Vegetation index; vertical soil salinity; Water depth; Yellow River,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(2) community sustainability presents a significant spatial distribution. the communities of high sustainability level are mainly located in both sides of the pearl river and emerging urban areas, while those of medium sustainability level are distributed sporadically in the study area and those of low sustainability level are concentrated in old towns.

papp et al., 2021), laying the foundation for precision agriculture (sishodia et al., 2020). making use of sensing systems to obtain (near real-time) environmental data, precision agriculture relies on the extraction of relevant, high-resolution geoinformation to be communicated visually to the end-user (sishodia et al., 2020). cartography as an interdisciplinary domain bears a huge potential in meeting the increasing demand for the decision-supporting visualisation of big data (coetzee et al., 2020; robinson et al., 2017), and thus may contribute to the development of more sustainable agriculture. the focus of this research is on plant disease detection, as plant pests endanger tree health and harvest, thus highlighting farmers' vulnerability to plant diseases and ultimately undermining sustainable development goals, such as zero hunger and food security (savary et al., 2012). in contrast to traditional plant disease management, plant health monitoring through hyperspectral data would enable stakeholders to detect plant stress outside the range of visible light, and hence, at an early disease stage. particularly, near- and short-wave infrared bands provide crucial information on plant health, allowing early intervention in plant disease control (lowe, harrison, & french, 2017). apple proliferation (ap), a phytoplasma disease transmitted through insects, will be used as a case study in the upper adige valley in south tyrol (italy) to propose a technology- and data-driven strategy for an early, non-destructive plant disease detection and monitoring based on hyperspectral data. the work in progress consists of the following research objectives: - developing a cartographic understanding and definition for a precision map, - identifying relevant spectral bands (sb's) and vegetation indices (vi's) that allow meaningful discrimination between leaves infected with ap and uninfected leaves (binary discrimination), - implementing a robust and reproducible image classification procedure based on a machine learning approach specifically for the identification of ap on varying levels of detail (at the leaf, tree, and orchard level), - establishing a mapping technique to produce precision maps dedicated to ap on different levels of detail following a multi-modal and multi-scale data acquisition approach, several remote sensing techniques were applied: adopting a ground sensing approach, individual leaf spectral signatures were obtained through a spectroradiometer equipped with a leaf clipping tool extension; airborne proximal sensing was conducted on the orchard level using uavmounted multi- and hyperspectral cameras. insights gained through the spectral data analysis served as the basis for the subsequent multi- and hyperspectral waveband selection and composition of adequate vegetation indices. additionally, machine learning techniques were adopted for image classification to delineate infected from uninfected trees. a hexagonal grid structure assimilating the tree rows is used for cartographic generalisation of the image classifications as well as for abstraction of the tree canopy shape by the individual hexagonal cell. finally, the high-resolution classification on the leaf level and the aggregated spatial information regarding the ap infection on the tree and orchard level (i.e. as gridded abstraction) are presented as interrelated map-layers. following shneiderman's (1996) visualisation mantra overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand, the map user will first be presented with a general overview of aggregated spatial data on the orchard level, from which he/she can move between layers through zooming to obtain further detail at the tree and intra-tree level. this multi-scale view in precision mapping is also temporal in nature, as multiple uav flights were undertaken in several phenological stages, providing further insight into the spatio-temporal disease evolution of apple proliferation. the findings will be available on the eurac research environmental data platform (https://www.maps.eurac.edu), a geoportal based on an open spatial data infrastructure (sdi) and managed by the center for sensing solutions. internally referred to as maps, the geoportal is based on software maintained by the open source geospatial foundation (osgeo), such that the interactive map user interface is based on the framework of geonode and openlayers. the spatial data is managed through postgis (a postgresql extension), which is then hosted through geoserver that in turn is coupled with pycsw as well as geonetwork as respective metadata catalogues. following coetzee et al.'s idea (2020), this research is anticipated to be open science, thus findings and geodata from this research should be accessible to the public through fair (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) (wilkinson et al. 2016), free and open-source geospatial software and infrastructure as well as map services. this experimental case study is expected to encourage future development and implementation of cartography in agriculture and foster the cartographic understanding and application of precision mapping using multi- and hyperspectral data. this research is partially funded by the erasmus+ student mobility program (scholarship) and supported by the european union's horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the marie skłodowska-curie grant agreement no 894215.

random forest, rf, and extreme gradient boost, xgboost) machine learning algorithms. the calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. the statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. the results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. in addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. the best models can accurately predict yield in january (4 months before harvest) with an r2 = 0.88 and rmse around 0.22 t. ha−1. the xgboost method exhibited the best metrics. finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the rmse by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. in conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting.",2021,19/01/2024 10:22,19/01/2024 10:37,NA,3101,NA,16,13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,Publicly Available Content Database,2565699871,NA,NA,Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG,NA,;

(2) ir band differences are still sensitive to heavy precipitation although the abilities of single ir bands have become insufficient. for example, ∆t7−8 are sensitive to heavy precipitation in the eye walls of the typhoons.
