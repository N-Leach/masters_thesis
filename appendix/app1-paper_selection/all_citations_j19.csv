However, managing Earth observation satellite data for a large region of interest is challenging in the task of creating land cover maps. Since satellite imagery is getting more precise and extensive, Big Data techniques are becoming essential to handle the rising quantity of data. Furthermore, given the complexity of managing and analysing the data, defining a methodology that reduces the complexity of the process into different smaller steps is vital to data processing. This paper presents a Big Data methodology for creating land cover maps employing artificial intelligence algorithms. Machine Learning algorithms are contemplated for remote sensing and geodata classification, supported by explainable artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the process considers aspects related to downloading data from different satellites, Copernicus and ASTER, executing the pre-processing and processing of the data in a distributed environment, and depicting the visualisation of the result. The methodology is validated in a test case for er map of the Mediterranean Basin.","2023-06","2024-01-16 09:03:45","2024-01-19 10:58:39","","91","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2821764695","","","Place: Heidelberg Publisher: Springer Nature B.V.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/ocVsR?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=J2b4wE4DWmTLUnDcOvvx%2FKarknM%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Scalable+approach+for+high-resolution+land+cover%3A+a+case+study+in+the+Mediterranean+Basin&title=Journal+of+Big+Data&issn=&date=2023-06-01&volume=10&issue=1&spage=91&au=Burgue%C3%B1o%2C+Antonio+Manuel%3BAldana-Mart%C3%ADn%2C+Jos%C3%A9+F.%3BV%C3%A1zquez-Pend%C3%B3n%2C+Mar%C3%ADa%3BBarba-Gonz%C3%A1lez%2C+Crist%C3%B3bal%3BJim%C3%A9nez+G%C3%B3mez%2C+Yaiza%3BGarc%C3%ADa+Mill%C3%A1n%2C+Virginia%3BNavas-Delgado%2C+Ismael&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+Big+Data&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2Fs40537-023-00770-z","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Big Data; Complexity; Computers--Electronic Data Processing; Data processing; Earth observations (from space); Explainable AI; Image classification; Land cover; Machine learning; Maps; Mediterranean Area; Methodology; Multispectral; Remote observing; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellite observation; Satellites; Spatial data; Workflow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we proposed a multi-depth soil salinity prediction model (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–40 cm, and 40–60 cm) fully using the advantages of satellite image data and field sampling to rapidly estimate the multi-depth soil salinity in the Yellow River Delta, China. Firstly, a multi-depth soil salinity predictive factor system was developed through correlation analysis of soil sample electrical conductivity with a series of remote-sensing parameters containing heat, moisture, salinity, vegetation indices, spectral value, and spatial location. Then, three machine learning methods including back propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) were adopted to construct a coastal soil salinity inversion model. By using the best inversion model, we obtain the spatial distribution of soil salinity in the Yellow River Delta. The results show the following: (1) Environmental variables in this study are all effective variables for soil salinity prediction. The most sensitive indicators to multi-depth soil salinity are GDVI, ENDVI, SI-T, NDWI, and LST. (2) The RF model was chosen as the optimal approach for predicting and mapping soil salinity based on performance at four soil depths. (3) The soil salinity profiles exhibited intricate coexistence of two distinct types: surface aggregated and homogeneous. The former was dominant in the east, where salinity was higher. The central and southwestern parts were mostly homogeneous, with lower soil salinity. (4) The soil salinity throughout the four depths examined was found to be most elevated in saltern and bare land and lowest in wetland vegetation and farmland, according to land-cover type. This study proposed a remote sensing prediction method for salinization in multiple soil layers in the coastal plain, which could provide decision support for spatial monitoring of land salinization and achieving land degradation neutrality targets.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:45","2024-01-19 10:54:58","","5640","","24","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2904924547","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/oYWmW?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=ubpSPT%2BsvQplnr5mTsDWlWZMk64%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Mapping+Multi-Depth+Soil+Salinity+Using+Remote+Sensing-Enabled+Machine+Learning+in+the+Yellow+River+Delta%2C+China&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=24&spage=5640&au=Zhang%2C+Haoran%3BFu%2C+Xin%3BZhang%2C+Yanna%3BZhaishuo+Qi%3BZhang%2C+Hengcai%3BXu%2C+Zhenghe&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15245640","Agricultural land; Artificial neural networks; Back propagation networks; China; Coastal plains; Coasts; Coexistence; Correlation analysis; Decision trees; Degradation; Electrical conductivity; Electrical resistivity; Inversion; Land cover; Land degradation; Land use; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Mapping; Neural networks; Physics; Precipitation; Prediction models; Remote sensing; Research methodology; Rivers; Salinity; Salinity effects; Salinization; Salt; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Soil analysis; Soil depth; soil layer; Soil layers; Soil mapping; Soil salinity; soil salinization; spatial distribution; Spatial distribution; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Vegetation index; vertical soil salinity; Water depth; Yellow River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It underscores the practical implications and benefits of the integrated approach combining machine learning, remote sensing, and proximal sensing for SOC estimation and prediction across a range of applications, including comprehensive soil health mapping and carbon credit assessment. These advanced technologies offer a promising pathway, reducing costs and resource utilization while improving the precision of SOC estimation. We conducted a comparative analysis between MIR-predicted SOC values and laboratory-measured SOC values using 36 soil samples. The results demonstrate a strong fit (R² = 0.83), underscoring the potential of this integrated approach. While acknowledging that our analysis is based on a limited sample size, these initial findings offer promise and serve as a foundation for future research. We will be providing updates when we obtain more data. Furthermore, this paper explores the potential for commercialising these technologies in Australia, with the aim of helping farmers harness the advantages of carbon markets. Based on our study’s findings, coupled with insights from the existing literature, we suggest that adopting this integrated SOC measurement approach could significantly benefit local economies, enhance farmers’ ability to monitor changes in soil health, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. These outcomes align with global climate change mitigation efforts. Furthermore, our study’s approach, supported by other research, offers a potential template for regions worldwide seeking similar solutions.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:45","2024-01-19 10:56:18","","5571","","23","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2899449427","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/8mvWW?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=7Xp0RDagY9ApqE0s5jNl9ojbCdY%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Preliminary+Results+in+Innovative+Solutions+for+Soil+Carbon+Estimation%3A+Integrating+Remote+Sensing%2C+Machine+Learning%2C+and+Proximal+Sensing+Spectroscopy&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=23&spage=5571&au=Li%2C+Tong%3BXia%2C+Anquan%3BMcLaren%2C+Timothy+I%3BPandey%2C+Rajiv%3BXu%2C+Zhihong%3BLiu%2C+Hongdou%3BManning%2C+Sean%3BMadgett%2C+Oli%3BDuncan%2C+Sam%3BRasmussen%2C+Peter%3BRuhnke%2C+Florian%3BY%C3%BCz%C3%BCg%C3%BCll%C3%BC%2C+Onur%3BFajraoui%2C+Noura%3BBeniwal%2C+Deeksha%3BChapman%2C+Scott%3BTsiminis%2C+Georgios%3BSmith%2C+Chaya%3BDalal%2C+Ram+C%3BDang%2C+Yash+P&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15235571","Agricultural practices; Algorithms; Australia; Carbon; carbon cycle; Climate change; Climate change mitigation; commercialization; Comparative analysis; Deep learning; Farmers; Global climate; Infrared spectra; Infrared spectroscopy; Learning algorithms; Local economy; low-cost estimation; Machine learning; model; Neural networks; Organic carbon; Organic soils; Physics; Remote sensing; Remote sensing systems; Resource utilization; Soil microorganisms; Soils; Spectrum analysis; Support vector machines; Sustainable agriculture; sustainable farming; Sustainable practices; Vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This review highlights the different detection methods, types, parts, and applications of RS techniques in soil measurements, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the measurements of soil properties. The choice of the methods depends on the specific requirements of the soil measurements task because it is important to consider the advantages and limitations of each method, as well as the specific context and objective of the soil measurements, to determine the most suitable RS technique. This paper follows a well-structured arrangement after investigating the existing literature to ensure a well-organized, coherent review and covers all the essential aspects related to studying the advancement of using RS in the measurements of soil properties. While several remote sensing methods are available, this review suggests spectral reflectance, which entails satellite remote sensing and other tools based on its global coverage, high spatial resolution, long-term monitoring capabilities, non-invasiveness, and cost effectiveness. Conclusively, RS has improved soil property measurements using various methods, but more research is needed for calibration, sensor fusion, artificial intelligence, validation, and machine learning applications to enhance accuracy and applicability.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:46","2024-01-19 10:28:18","","15444","","21","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2888386951","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/KPXCW?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=5X%2B5uXPJNftTynUVPupKaA5MiMQ%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Advancement+of+Remote+Sensing+for+Soil+Measurements+and+Applications%3A+A+Comprehensive+Review&title=Sustainability&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=21&spage=15444&au=Mukhtar+Iderawumi+Abdulraheem%3BZhang%2C+Wei%3BLi%2C+Shixin%3BAta+Jahangir+Moshayedi%3BFarooque%2C+Aitazaz+A%3BHu%2C+Jiandong&isbn=&jtitle=Sustainability&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsu152115444","Agricultural management; Agricultural production; Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Data analysis; Decision making; Environmental management; Environmental monitoring; Environmental Studies; Land use planning; Machine learning; multispectral analysis; proximal sensing; Radar; Radiation; Remote sensing; remote sensing (RS); satellite sensing; Satellites; Sensors; Soil erosion; soil properties and variability; Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral sensors have significantly advanced remote sensing, enabling the provision of near-real-time data for crop analysis at the plot level in small, fragmented croplands where NUS are often grown. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on the remote sensing (RS) of the spatial distribution and health of NUS, evaluating the progress, opportunities, challenges, and associated research gaps. This study systematically reviewed 171 peer-reviewed articles from Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science using the PRISMA approach. The findings of this study showed that the United States (n = 18) and China (n = 17) were the primary study locations, with some contributions from the Global South, including southern Africa. The observed NUS crop attributes included crop yield, growth, leaf area index (LAI), above-ground biomass (AGB), and chlorophyll content. Only 29% of studies explored stomatal conductance and the spatial distribution of NUS. Twenty-one studies employed satellite-borne sensors, while only eighteen utilised UAV-borne sensors in conjunction with machine learning (ML), multivariate, and generic GIS classification techniques for mapping the spatial extent and health of NUS. The use of UAVs in mapping NUS is progressing slowly, particularly in the Global South, due to exorbitant purchasing and operational costs, as well as restrictive regulations. Subsequently, research efforts must be directed toward combining ML techniques and UAV-acquired data to monitor NUS’ spatial distribution and health to provide necessary information for optimising food production in smallholder croplands in the Global South.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:46","2024-01-19 10:27:53","","4672","","19","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2876641790","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/QqkpV?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=2OoeWdibz2l5JqvrgOxRGFPx9t0%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=A+Systematic+Review+of+UAV+Applications+for+Mapping+Neglected+and+Underutilised+Crop+Species%26rsquo%3B+Spatial+Distribution+and+Health&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=19&spage=4672&au=Abrahams%2C+Mishkah%3BSibanda%2C+Mbulisi%3BDube%2C+Timothy%3BVimbayi+G+P+Chimonyo%3BMabhaudhi%2C+Tafadzwanashe&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15194672","Agricultural land; Agricultural production; Bibliometrics; Chlorophyll; Climate change; crop health; Crop yield; Crops; Data acquisition; Developing countries--LDCs; drones; Food; Food production; food security; Geographical distribution; Keywords; Leaf area; Leaf area index; Literature reviews; Machine learning; Mapping; Morphology; NUS; Nutrition; Physics; precision agriculture; Productivity; Remote sensing; Remote sensors; Sensors; Spatial data; spatial distribution; Spatial distribution; Stomata; stomatal conductance; Stomatal conductance; Trends; UAV; Unmanned aerial vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the setbacks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the agriculture and allied sectors in India exhibited resilience, registered a growth of 3.4% during 2020–2121, even as the overall economic growth declined by 7.2% during the same period. The improvement of the agriculture sector holds paramount importance in sustaining the increasing population and safeguarding food security. Consequently, researchers worldwide have been concentrating on digitally transforming agriculture by leveraging advanced technologies to establish smart, sustainable, and lucrative farming systems. The advancement in remote sensing (RS) and machine learning (ML) has proven beneficial for farmers and policymakers in minimizing crop losses and optimizing resource utilization through valuable crop insights. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of studies dedicated to the application of RS and ML in addressing agriculture-related challenges in India. We conducted a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and evaluated research articles published from 2015 to 2022. The objective of this study is to shed light on the application of both RS and ML technique across key agricultural domains, encompassing “crop management”, “soil management”, and “water management, ultimately leading to their improvement. This study primarily focuses on assessing the current status of using intelligent geospatial data analytics in Indian agriculture. Majority of the studies were carried out in the crop management category, where the deployment of various RS sensors led yielded substantial improvements in agricultural monitoring. The integration of remote sensing technology and machine learning techniques can enable an intelligent approach to agricultural monitoring, thereby providing valuable recommendations and insights for effective agricultural management.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:46","2024-01-19 10:54:34","","2302","","9","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Coronavirus Research Database; Publicly Available Content Database","2869223923","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/R0obV?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=rwjoDjBOoDWNMQ3Px4xQG0GX%2FnI%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Machine+Learning-Driven+Remote+Sensing+Applications+for+Agriculture+in+India%26mdash%3BA+Systematic+Review&title=Agronomy&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=13&issue=9&spage=2302&au=Pokhariyal%2C+Shweta%3BPatel%2C+N+R%3BGovind%2C+Ajit&isbn=&jtitle=Agronomy&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fagronomy13092302","Agricultural management; agriculture; Agriculture; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Big Data; Business metrics; Classification; Corn; COVID-19; crop management; Crops; Economic development; Economic growth; Farming systems; Food security; India; Internet of Things; Learning algorithms; Literature reviews; machine learning; Machine learning; Meta-analysis; Monitoring; Pandemics; Performance evaluation; Population growth; remote sensing; Remote sensing; Remote sensors; Resource utilization; Satellites; Sensors; soil management; Soil management; Soil water; Spatial data; Unmanned aerial vehicles; water management; Water management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning has potential in large-scale GPP prediction, but its application accuracy and impact factors still need further research. This paper takes the Mongolian Plateau as the research area. Six machine learning methods (multilayer perception, random forest, Adaboost, gradient boosting decision tree, XGBoost, LightGBM) were trained using remote sensing data (MODIS GPP) and 14 impact factor data and carried out the prediction of grassland GPP. Then, using flux observation data (positions of flux stations) and remote sensing data (positions of non-flux stations) as reference data, detailed accuracy evaluation and comprehensive trade-offs are carried out on the results, and key factors affecting prediction performance are further explored. The results show that: (1) The prediction results of the six methods are highly consistent with the change tendency of the reference data, demonstrating the applicability of machine learning in GPP prediction. (2) LightGBM has the best overall performance, with small absolute error (mean absolute error less than 1.3), low degree of deviation (root mean square error less than 3.2), strong model reliability (relative percentage difference more than 5.9), and a high degree of fit with reference data (regression determination coefficient more than 0.97), and the prediction results are closest to the reference data (mean bias is only −0.034). (3) Enhanced vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index, precipitation, land use/land cover, maximum air temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and evapotranspiration are significantly higher than other factors as determining factors, and the total contribution ratio to the prediction accuracy exceeds 95%. They are the main factors influencing GPP prediction. This study can provide a reference for the application of machine learning in GPP prediction and also support the research of large-scale GPP prediction.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:46","2024-01-19 10:30:10","","3475","","14","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2843104323","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/RKHYT?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=RBeNXmDkk3XmXhoGxd41Eu%2Bvsq8%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Assessment+of+Six+Machine+Learning+Methods+for+Predicting+Gross+Primary+Productivity+in+Grassland&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=14&spage=3475&au=Wang%2C+Hao%3BShao%2C+Wei%3BHu%2C+Yunfeng%3BCao%2C+Wei%3BZhang%2C+Yunzhi&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15143475","Accuracy; Air temperature; Artificial intelligence; Carbon; Carbon cycle; Datasets; Decision trees; Errors; Evapotranspiration; Fluctuations; Grasslands; gross primary productivity; Impact factors; key factors; Land cover; Land use; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Mongolia; Mongolian Plateau; Multilayers; Neural networks; Normalized difference vegetative index; Physics; Physiology; Precipitation; prediction; Predictions; Productivity; Radiation; Remote observing; Remote sensing; Simulation; Support vector machines; Vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present Reef-Insight, an unsupervised machine learning framework that features advanced clustering methods and remote sensing for reef habitat mapping. Our framework compares different clustering methods for reef habitat mapping using remote sensing data. We evaluate four major clustering approaches based on qualitative and visual assessments which include k-means, hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture model, and density-based clustering. We utilise remote sensing data featuring the One Tree Island reef in Australia’s Southern Great Barrier Reef. Our results indicate that clustering methods using remote sensing data can well identify benthic and geomorphic clusters in reefs when compared with other studies. Our results indicate that Reef-Insight can generate detailed reef habitat maps outlining distinct reef habitats and has the potential to enable further insights for reef restoration projects.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:47","2024-01-19 10:57:25","","373","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2843065858","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/MC0YT?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=ntiXLp2EEEMojrhHEXsaFsEUCpg%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Reef-Insight%3A+A+Framework+for+Reef+Habitat+Mapping+with+Clustering+Methods+Using+Remote+Sensing&title=Information&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=14&issue=7&spage=373&au=Barve%2C+Saharsh%3BWebster%2C+Jody+M%3BChandra%2C+Rohitash&isbn=&jtitle=Information&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Finfo14070373","Algorithms; Classification; Climate change; Cluster analysis; clustering; Clustering; Coastal zone; Computers--Information Science And Information Theory; Coral reefs; Data processing; Datasets; Environmental monitoring; Geomorphology; Great Barrier Reef; machine learning; Machine learning; Mapping; Maps; Mineral exploration; Oceans; One Tree Island; Open source software; Probabilistic models; Qualitative analysis; reef habitat mapping; Remote sensing; Research & development--R&D; Satellites; Strategic management; Topography; Unsupervised learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last four decades, major research efforts in the field of pedometrics have led to the development of methods allowing to capture the complex nature of soils. As a result, digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches have been developed for quantifying soils in space and time. DSM and monitoring have become operational thanks to the harmonization of soil databases, advances in spatial modeling and machine learning, and the increasing availability of spatiotemporal covariates, including the exponential increase in freely available remote sensing (RS) data. The latter boosted research in DSM, allowing the mapping of soils at high resolution and assessing the changes through time. We present a review of the main contributions and developments of French (inter)national research, which has a long history in both RS and DSM. Thanks to the French SPOT satellite constellation that started in the early 1980s, the French RS and soil research communities have pioneered DSM using remote sensing. This review describes the data, tools, and methods using RS imagery to support the spatial predictions of a wide range of soil properties and discusses their pros and cons. The review demonstrates that RS data are frequently used in soil mapping (i) by considering them as a substitute for analytical measurements, or (ii) by considering them as covariates related to the controlling factors of soil formation and evolution. It further highlights the great potential of RS imagery to improve DSM, and provides an overview of the main challenges and prospects related to digital soil mapping and future sensors. This opens up broad prospects for the use of RS for DSM and natural resource monitoring.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:47","2024-01-19 10:57:30","","3070","","12","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2829884972","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/952VS?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=zaEDxAPEUV6oHqVQTUwXBipudJA%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Remote+Sensing+Data+for+Digital+Soil+Mapping+in+French+Research%26mdash%3BA+Review&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=12&spage=3070&au=Richer-de-Forges%2C+Anne+C%3BChen%2C+Qianqian%3BBaghdadi%2C+Nicolas%3BChen%2C+Songchao%3BGomez%2C+C%C3%A9cile%3BJacquemoud%2C+St%C3%A9phane%3BMartelet%2C+Guillaume%3BMulder%2C+Vera+L%3BUrbina-Salazar%2C+Diego%3BVaudour%2C+Emmanuelle%3BWeiss%2C+Marie%3BWigneron%2C+Jean-Pierre%3BArrouays%2C+Dominique&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15123070","Availability; Climate change; covariates; Digital mapping; Europe; Imagery; Machine learning; Mapping; Monitoring; Natural resources; Physics; remote sensing; Remote sensing; resolution; review; Reviews; sampling density; Satellite constellations; scale; sensors; soil digital soil mapping; Soil erosion; Soil formation; Soil mapping; Soil properties; Soil sciences; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Vegetation; wavelengths; Working groups","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Remote sensing provides the most efficient and cost-effective solution for the measurement of important agricultural parameters such as soil moisture level, but retrieval of the soil moisture contents from coarse resolution datasets, especially microwave datasets, remains a challenging task. In the present work, a machine learning-based framework is proposed to generate the enhanced resolution soil moisture products, i.e., classified maps and change maps, using an optical-based moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and microwave-based scatterometer satellite (SCATSAT-1) datasets. In the proposed framework, nearest-neighbor-based image fusion (NNIF), artificial neural networks (ANN), and post-classification-based change detection (PCCD) have been integrated to generate thematic and change maps. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework, random forest post-classification-based change detection (RFPCD) has also been implemented, and it is concluded that the proposed framework achieved better results (88.67–91.80%) as compared to the RFPCD (86.80–87.80%) in the computation of change maps with σ°-HH. This study is important in terms of crop yield prediction analysis via the delivery of enhanced-resolution soil moisture products under all weather conditions.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:47","2024-01-19 10:26:31","","28","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2829845647","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/5YqUS?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=%2BjFifLvAC7nQsbJ7%2FYOYJZ936Xk%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=A+Framework+for+Crop+Yield+Estimation+and+Change+Detection+Using+Image+Fusion+of+Microwave+and+Optical+Satellite+Dataset&title=Quaternary&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=6&issue=2&spage=28&au=Kaur%2C+Ravneet%3BReet+Kamal+Tiwari%3BMaini%2C+Raman%3BSingh%2C+Sartajvir&isbn=&jtitle=Quaternary&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fquat6020028","Agricultural production; Agriculture; Artificial neural networks; Change detection; Classification; Computer vision; crop yield; Crop yield; Crops; Datasets; Decision making; Decision trees; Earth Sciences--Geology; fusion; India; Machine learning; moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS); Moisture content; Moisture effects; Nearest-neighbor; Neural networks; Product development; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; scatterometer satellite (SCATSAT-1); Sensors; soil moisture; Soil moisture; Spectroradiometers; Sustainable agriculture; Weather","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extracting cropland from remote sensing imagery is challenging due to spectral diversity and mixed pixels. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have facilitated the availability of very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images that provide detailed ground information. However, VHR cropland extraction in southern China is difficult because of the high heterogeneity and fragmentation of cropland and the insufficient observations of VHR sensors. To address these challenges, we proposed a deep learning-based method for automated high-resolution cropland extraction. The method used an improved HRRS-U-Net model to accurately identify the extent of cropland and explicitly locate field boundaries. The HRRS-U-Net maintained high-resolution details throughout the network to generate precise cropland boundaries. Additionally, the residual learning (RL) and the channel attention mechanism (CAM) were introduced to extract deeper discriminative representations. The proposed method was evaluated over four city-wide study areas (Qingyuan, Yangjiang, Guangzhou, and Shantou) with a diverse range of agricultural systems, using GaoFen-2 (GF-2) images. The cropland extraction results for the study areas had an overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 97.00% to 98.33%, with F1 scores (F1) of 0.830–0.940 and Kappa coefficients (Kappa) of 0.814–0.929. The OA was 97.85%, F1 was 0.915, and Kappa was 0.901 over all study areas. Moreover, our proposed method demonstrated advantages compared to machine learning methods (e.g., RF) and previous semantic segmentation models, such as U-Net, U-Net++, U-Net3+, and MPSPNet. The results demonstrated the generalization ability and reliability of the proposed method for cropland extraction in southern China using VHR remote images.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:47","2024-01-19 10:40:55","","2231","","9","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2812742648","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/VP8aR?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=VrKlKz3wFwralXRsSL%2B4ZuNq3Bk%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Cropland+Extraction+in+Southern+China+from+Very+High-Resolution+Images+Based+on+Deep+Learning&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=9&spage=2231&au=Xie%2C+Dehua%3BXu%2C+Han%3BXiong%2C+Xiliu%3BLiu%2C+Min%3BHu%2C+Haoran%3BXiong%2C+Mengsen%3BLiu%2C+Luo&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15092231","Agricultural land; Agricultural policy; Algorithms; Boundaries; China; Classification; Cropland; cropland extraction; Datasets; deep learning; Deep learning; Farming systems; Food security; Food supply; GF-2; Guangdong China; Heterogeneity; High resolution; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Land surveys; Machine learning; Methods; Performance evaluation; Physics; Remote sensing; Semantic segmentation; Semantics; southern China; very high-resolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a raw material for industrial and non-industrial products important to the world economy. The sustainability of natural rubber production is, therefore, critical for smallholder livelihoods and economic development. To maintain price stability, it is important to estimate the yields in advance. Remote sensing technology can effectively provide large-scale spatial data; however, productivity estimates need to be processed from high spatial resolution data generated from satellites with high accuracy and reliability, especially for smallholder livelihood areas where smaller plots contrast with large farms. This study used reflectance data from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery acquired for the 12 months between December 2020 and November 2021. The imagery included 213 plots where data on rubber production in smallholder agriculture were collected. Six vegetation indices (Vis), namely Green Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (GSAVI), Modified Simple Ratio (MSR), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Green (NR), and Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) were used to estimate the rubber yield. The study found that the red edge spectral band (band 5) provided the best prediction with R2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 29.63 kg/ha, outperforming all other spectral bands and VIs. The MSR index provided the highest coefficient of determination, with R2 = 0.62 and RMSE = 39.25 kg/ha. When the red edge reflectance was combined with the best VI, MSR, the prediction model only slightly improved, with a coefficient determination of (R2) of 0.80 and an RMSE of 29.42 kg/ha. The results demonstrated that the Sentinel-2 data are suitable for rubber yield prediction for smallholder farmers. The findings of this study can be used as a guideline to apply in other countries or areas. Future studies will require the use of reflectance and vegetation indices derived from satellite data in combination with meteorological data, as well as the application of complex models, such as machine learning and deep learning.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:47","2024-01-19 10:44:02","","7223","","9","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2812741402","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/n28aR?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=ntYB51KX8nqrnH7CW1%2Bq8ip3KXE%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Estimation+of+Rubber+Yield+Using+Sentinel-2+Satellite+Data&title=Sustainability&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=9&spage=7223&au=Bhumiphan%2C+Niwat%3BNontapon%2C+Jurawan%3BKaewplang%2C+Siwa%3BNeti+Srihanu%3BKoedsin%2C+Werapong%3BHuete%2C+Alfredo&isbn=&jtitle=Sustainability&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsu15097223","Accounting; Agricultural production; Agriculture; Atmospheric models; Copernicus Programme; Deep learning; Economic development; Environmental Studies; Global economy; Image acquisition; India; Indonesia; Industrial products; Landsat satellites; Malaysia; Meteorological data; natural rubber; Natural rubber; Normalization; Normalized difference vegetative index; Plantations; Prediction models; Price stabilization; Raw materials; reflectance; Reflectance; Remote sensing; Rice; Rubber; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Sentinel-2; Small farms; smallholder; Spatial data; Spatial discrimination; Spatial resolution; Spectral bands; Sustainability; Thailand; Time series; Vegetation; Vegetation Index; Yield; yield estimation model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several issues need to be addressed while developing a crop yield estimation model, including data quality issues, data processing issues, selecting a suitable machine learning model that can learn from few available time-series data, and understanding the non-linear relationship between historical crop yield and remote sensing and meteorological factors. This study applied a series of data processing techniques and a customized ML model to improve the accuracy of crop yield estimation at the district level in Nepal. It was found that remote sensing-derived NDVI product alone was not sufficient for accurate estimation of crop yield. After incorporating other meteorological variables into the ML models, estimation accuracy improved dramatically. Along with NDVI, the meteorological variables of rainfall, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration also exhibited a strong association with rice yield. This study also found that stacking multiple tree-based regression models together could achieve better accuracy than benchmark linear regression or standalone ML models. Due to the unique and distinct physio-geographical setting of each district, a variation in estimation accuracy from district to district could be observed. Our data processing and ML model workflow achieved an average of 92% accuracy of yield estimation with RMSE 328.06 kg/ha and MAE 317.21 kg/ha. This methodological workflow can be replicated in other study areas and the results can help the local authorities and stakeholders understand the factors affecting crop yields as well as estimating crop yield before harvesting season to ensure food security and sustainability.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:48","2024-01-19 10:57:13","","2374","","9","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2812734327","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/KD7aR?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=lz3NxaZ63xwfcA4H7DndLH2n3co%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Rapid+Rice+Yield+Estimation+Using+Integrated+Remote+Sensing+and+Meteorological+Data+and+Machine+Learning&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=9&spage=2374&au=Md+Didarul+Islam%3BDi%2C+Liping%3BQamer%2C+Faisal+Mueen%3BShrestha%2C+Sravan%3BGuo%2C+Liying%3BLi%2C+Lin%3BMayer%2C+Timothy+J%3BPhalke%2C+Aparna+R&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15092374","Accuracy; Agricultural production; Agriculture; Atmospheric models; crop phenology; crop yield; Crop yield; crop yield estimation; Crops; Customization; Data processing; Datasets; Estimation; Evapotranspiration; Food security; Harvest; Harvesting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Meteorological data; Model accuracy; Moisture effects; multisource remotely sensed data; Nepal; Physics; Precipitation; precision agriculture; Prediction models; Radiation; Rain; Rainfall; Regression analysis; Regression models; Remote sensing; Rice; Soil moisture; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Temperature; Vegetation; Water shortages; Wind; Workflow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of geospatial information and technology has been recognized as a valuable tool to help farmers reduce the adverse impacts of natural disasters on agriculture. Remote sensing and GIS are gaining traction as ways to improve agricultural disaster response due to recent advancements in spatial resolution, accessibility, and affordability. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the FAIR agricultural disaster services. It holistically introduces the current status, case studies, technologies, and challenges, and it provides a big picture of exploring geospatial applications for agricultural disaster “from farm to space”. The review begins with an overview of the governments and organizations worldwide. We present the major international and national initiatives relevant to the agricultural disaster context. The second part of this review illustrates recent research on remote sensing-based agricultural disaster monitoring, with a special focus on drought and flood events. Traditional, integrative, and machine learning-based methods are highlighted in this section. We then examine the role of spatial data infrastructure and research on agricultural disaster services and systems. The generic lifecycle of agricultural disasters is briefly introduced. Eventually, we discuss the grand challenges and emerging opportunities that range from analysis-ready data to decision-ready services, providing guidance on the foreseeable future.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:48","2024-01-19 10:43:29","","2024","","8","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Coronavirus Research Database; Publicly Available Content Database","2806583672","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/cOGQR?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=jd%2F1YrYk2BSZMhnIQxDICD5ipSc%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Enhancing+FAIR+Data+Services+in+Agricultural+Disaster%3A+A+Review&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=8&spage=2024&au=Hu%2C+Lei%3BZhang%2C+Chenxiao%3BZhang%2C+Mingda%3BShi%2C+Yuming%3BLu%2C+Jiasheng%3BFang%2C+Zhe&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15082024","Africa; agricultural disaster; Agricultural research; Agriculture; Asia; Climate change; Cooperation; Decision analysis; Decision making; Developing countries--LDCs; Disaster management; Disasters; drought; Drought; earth observation; Emergency communications systems; Emergency preparedness; FAIR; FAIR data; Farms; flood; Flood; Food security; Forest & brush fires; Geographic information systems; Infrastructure; International organizations; Interoperability; Life cycle analysis; Machine learning; Natural disasters; Physics; Remote sensing; Research & development--R&D; Reviews; Rural areas; Rural development; Spatial data; spatial data infrastructure; Spatial discrimination; Spatial resolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The GF-1 high-resolution remote sensing images of 2013, 2015, and 2020 were used in this study to reflect the land use change in urban villages before and after urban renewal by using a hierarchical machine learning recognition method based on scene-based and random forest classification. The overall scale of urban village blocks in Haidian was 10.46 km2, showing the distribution pattern along the traffic arteries in 2013. In 2015, it dropped to 10.11 km2. The scale of urban village blocks in 2020 decreased to 1.02 km2, 9.75% of that in 2013. Three kinds of urban village renewal logic are revealed by further taking Chuanying Village as an example: “urban village–blue–green space”, “urban village–real estate”, and “urban village–municipal facilities”.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:48","2024-01-19 10:59:49","","1835","","7","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2799747502","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/ZCMGR?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=acXeXhM%2B1Aka5LQWp7oezJN%2BDuM%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=The+Vanishing+and+Renewal+Landscape+of+Urban+Villages+Using+High-Resolution+Remote+Sensing%3A+The+Case+of+Haidian+District+in+Beijing&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=7&spage=1835&au=Hubin%2C+Wei%3BCao%2C+Yue%3BQi%2C+Wei&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15071835","Arteries; Beijing; Buildings; China; Cost of living; Geography; Haidian District; High resolution; Image resolution; Land purchases; Land use; land use change; Landscape; Machine learning; Pearl River (China); Physics; Real estate; Remote sensing; Rural areas; scene-based; Semantics; Towns; Urban; Urban areas; Urban development; urban renewal; Urban renewal; urban village; Urban village; Urbanization; Villages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning have allowed for high-resolution species distribution modeling that can inform landscape-level decision-making. Here we compare the performance of three popular Sentinel-2 (10-m) land cover maps, including dynamic world (DW), European land cover (ELC10), and world cover (WC), in predicting wild bee species richness over southern Norway. The proportion of grassland habitat within 250 m (derived from the land cover maps), along with temperature and distance to sandy soils, were used as predictors in both Bayesian regularized neural network and random forest models. Models using grassland habitat from DW performed best (RMSE = 2.8 ± 0.03; average ± standard deviation across models), followed by ELC10 (RMSE = 2.85 ± 0.03) and WC (RMSE = 2.87 ± 0.02). All satellite-derived maps outperformed a manually mapped Norwegian land cover dataset called AR5 (RMSE = 3.02 ± 0.02). When validating the model predictions of bee species richness against citizen science data on solitary bee occurrences using generalized linear models, we found that ELC10 performed best (AIC = 2278 ± 4), followed by WC (AIC = 2367 ± 3), and DW (AIC = 2376 ± 3). While the differences in RMSE we observed between models were small, they may be significant when such models are used to prioritize grassland patches within a landscape for conservation subsidies or management policies. Partial dependencies in our models showed that increasing the proportion of grassland habitat is positively associated with wild bee species richness, thereby justifying bee conservation schemes that aim to enhance semi-natural grassland habitat. Our results confirm the utility of satellite-derived land cover maps in supporting high-resolution species distribution modeling and suggest there is scope to monitor changes in species distributions over time given the dense time series provided by products such as DW.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:48","2024-01-19 10:37:27","","1749","","7","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2799689949","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/v29GR?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=DBui%2Fxusr9fu8LDEHPUu8YaEznU%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Comparing+Global+Sentinel-2+Land+Cover+Maps+for+Regional+Species+Distribution+Modeling&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=7&spage=1749&au=Venter%2C+Zander+S%3BRoos%2C+Ruben+E%3BNowell%2C+Megan+S%3BRusch%2C+Graciela+M%3BKvifte%2C+Gunnar+M%3BSydenham%2C+Markus+A+K&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15071749","Bayesian analysis; Bees; Biodiversity; Citizen science; Climate change; conservation; Conservation; Decision making; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Environmental economics; Generalized linear model; Geographical distribution; grassland; Grasslands; Habitats; High resolution; Insects; Land conservation; Land cover; Land use; Land use management; Landscape; Landscape preservation; Machine learning; management; Mapping; Maps; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Norway; Physics; Plant reproduction; pollinators; Random forest; Remote sensing; Sandy soils; Satellites; Soil temperature; spatial modeling; Species distribution; Species richness; Statistical models; Subsidies; Temperature; Variables; wild bees; Wildlife conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Timely and accurate phenotyping of fruit-tree crops is essential for innovating and achieving precision agriculture in the horticulture industry. Traditional methods for fruit-tree crop classification are time-consuming, costly, and often impossible to use for mapping heterogeneous horticulture systems. The application of remote sensing in smallholder agricultural landscapes is more promising. However, intercropping systems coupled with the presence of dispersed small agricultural fields that are characterized by common and uncommon crop types result in imbalanced samples, which may limit conventionally applied classification methods for phenotyping. This study assessed the influence of balanced and imbalanced multi-class distribution and data-sampling techniques on fruit-tree crop detection accuracy. Seven data samples were used as input to adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. A pixel-based approach was applied using Sentinel-2 (S2). The SVM algorithm produced the highest classification accuracy of 71%, compared with AdaBoost (67%), RF (65%), XGBoost (63%), and GB (62%), respectively. Individually, the majority of the crop types were classified with an F1 score of between 60% and 100%. In addition, the study assessed the effect of size and ratio of class imbalance in the training datasets on algorithms’ sensitiveness and stability. The results show that the highest classification accuracy of 71% could be achieved from an imbalanced training dataset containing only 60% of the original dataset. The results also showed that S2 data could be successfully used to map fruit-tree crops and provide valuable information for subtropical crop management and precision agriculture in heterogeneous horticultural landscapes.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:49","2024-01-19 10:45:18","","70","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2794659146","","","Place: Calgary Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/BkZ4R?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=WQocB0%2FCbaYeq%2BT4yA2aZrHmPos%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Exploring+the+Effect+of+Balanced+and+Imbalanced+Multi-Class+Distribution+Data+and+Sampling+Techniques+on+Fruit-Tree+Crop+Classification+Using+Different+Machine+Learning+Classifiers&title=Geomatics&issn=26737418&date=2023-01-01&volume=3&issue=1&spage=70&au=Chabalala%2C+Yingisani%3BElhadi+Adam%3BKhalid+Adem+Ali&isbn=&jtitle=Geomatics&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fgeomatics3010004","Accuracy; Agricultural production; Algorithms; Classification; Crops; Datasets; Farming; Food security; Fruits; Geography--Computer Applications; horticulture; imbalanced data; Machine learning; machine learning algorithms; Maps; Mountains; Research; sampling techniques; Sampling techniques; Sentinel-2; Sentinel-2 data; South Africa; Support vector machines; Sustainable agriculture; Wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soil organic matter (SOM) and calcium carbonate are important factors in soil quality, and although organic matter is well studied, calcium carbonates require more investigation. In this study, we validated the performance of laboratory soil spectroscopy for estimating the aforementioned properties with referenced in situ data. We also examined the performance of imaging spectroscopy sensors, such as the airborne HySpex and the spaceborne PRISMA. For this purpose, we applied four commonly used machine learning algorithms and six preprocessing methods for the evaluation of the best fitting algorithm.. The study took place over crop areas of Amyntaio in Northern Greece, where extensive soil sampling was conducted. This is an area with a very variable mineralogical environment (from lignite mine to mountainous area). The SOM results were very good at the laboratory scale and for both remote sensing sensors with R2 = 0.79 for HySpex and R2 = 0.76 for PRISMA. Regarding the calcium carbonate estimations, the remote sensing accuracy was R2 = 0.82 for HySpex and R2 = 0.36 for PRISMA. PRISMA was still in the commissioning phase at the time of the study, and therefore, the acquired image did not cover the whole study area. Accuracies for calcium carbonates may be lower due to the smaller sample size used for the modeling procedure. The results show the potential for using quantitative predictions of SOM and the carbonate content based on soil and imaging spectroscopy at the air and spaceborne scales and for future applications using larger datasets.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:49","2024-01-19 10:44:53","","1106","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2779684539","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/DunmQ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=UwCiw2ROowfcYbhoABjD6LE%2FK6Q%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Evaluation+of+Airborne+HySpex+and+Spaceborne+PRISMA+Hyperspectral+Remote+Sensing+Data+for+Soil+Organic+Matter+and+Carbonates+Estimation&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=4&spage=1106&au=Angelopoulou%2C+Theodora%3BChabrillat%2C+Sabine%3BPignatti%2C+Stefano%3BMilewski%2C+Robert%3BKaryotis%2C+Konstantinos%3BBrell%2C+Maximilian%3BRuhtz%2C+Thomas%3BBochtis%2C+Dionysis%3BZalidis%2C+George&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15041106","Accuracy; airborne; Airborne sensing; Algorithms; Analytical chemistry; Calcium carbonate; Carbonates; Data mining; Estimation; Greece; Hyperspectral imaging; Image acquisition; imaging spectroscopy; Laboratories; Lignite; Machine learning; Methods; Mountainous areas; organic carbon; Organic matter; Organic soils; Physics; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; remote sensing; Remote sensing; Remote sensors; satellite; Sensors; Soil organic matter; Soil properties; Soil quality; Soil sampling; soil spectroscopy; spectral modeling; Spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation are the second largest source of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Even though the emissions vary from region to region, a significant amount of carbon emissions comes mostly from timber harvesting, which is tightly linked to the selective logging intensity. This study intended to utilize a remote sensing approach to quantify carbon emissions from selective logging activities in Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia. To quantify the emissions, the relevant variables from the logging’s impact were identified as a predictor in the model development and were listed as stump height, stump diameter, cross-sectional area, timber volume, logging gaps, road, skid trails, and incidental damage resulting from the logging process. The predictive performance of linear regression and machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and K-nearest neighbor, were examined to assess the carbon emission from this degraded forest. To test the different methods, a combination of ground inventory plots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and satellite imagery were analyzed, and the performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and coefficient of correlation (R2) were calculated. Among the four models tested, the machine learning model SVM provided the best accuracy with an RMSE of 21.10% and a bias of 0.23% with an adjusted R2 of 0.80. Meanwhile, the linear model performed second with an RMSE of 22.14%, a bias of 0.72%, and an adjusted R2 of 0.75. This study demonstrates the efficacy of remotely sensed data to facilitate the conventional methods of quantifying carbon emissions from selective logging and promoting advanced assessments that are more effective, especially in massive logging areas and various forest conditions. Findings from this research will be useful in assisting the relevant authorities in optimizing logging practices to sustain forest carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:50","2024-01-19 10:55:14","","1016","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2779565277","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/vGgmQ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=xdY1icObruHSIy1xrLK9UrvuMjE%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Modeling+Carbon+Emissions+of+Post-Selective+Logging+in+the+Production+Forests+of+Ulu+Jelai%2C+Pahang%2C+Malaysia&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=4&spage=1016&au=Siti+Nor+Maizah+Saad%3BWan+Shafrina+Wan+Mohd+Jaafar%3BHamdan%2C+Omar%3BKhairul+Nizam+Abdul+Maulud%3BAisyah+Marliza+Muhmad+Kamarulzaman%3BAdrah%2C+Esmaeel%3BNorzalyta+Mohd+Ghazali%3BMohan%2C+Midhun&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15041016","Anthropogenic factors; Area; Atmospheric models; Automation; Bias; Carbon; carbon emission; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Climate change mitigation; Damage; Data collection; Deforestation; Emission analysis; Emissions; Forest; Forest degradation; Forest management; Forestry; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Harvest; Human influences; Investigations; Land degradation; Learning algorithms; Logging; Machine learning; machine learning model; Malaysia; Performance prediction; Physics; Regression analysis; remote sensing; Remote sensing; Root-mean-square errors; Satellite imagery; Satellites; selective logging impacts; Support vector machines; Timber; Timber construction; Trees; Tropical forests; UAV; Unmanned aerial vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many studies have been carried out to estimate LAI with remote sensing data obtained by sensors mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in major crops; however, most of the studies used only a single type of sensor, and the comparative study of different sensors and sensor combinations in the model construction of LAI was rarely reported, especially in soybean. In this study, three types of sensors, i.e., hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR, were used to collect remote sensing data at three growth stages in soybean. Six typical machine learning algorithms, including Unary Linear Regression (ULR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back Propagation (BP), were used to construct prediction models of LAI. The results indicated that the hyperspectral and LiDAR data did not significantly improve the prediction accuracy of LAI. Comparison of different sensors and sensor combinations showed that the fusion of the hyperspectral and multispectral data could significantly improve the predictive ability of the models, and among all the prediction models constructed by different algorithms, the prediction model built by XGBoost based on multimodal data showed the best performance. Comparison of the models for different growth stages showed that the XGBoost-LAI model for the flowering stage and the universal models of the XGBoost-LAI and RF-LAI for three growth stages showed the best performances. The results of this study might provide some ideas for the accurate estimation of LAI, and also provide novel insights toward high-throughput phenotyping of soybean with multi-modal remote sensing data.","2023","2024-01-16 09:03:50","2024-01-19 11:00:13","","7","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2761199743","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/V9IQQ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=VqfXdHk7t4O3tTPHZNVRPKRs43Y%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Toward+Multi-Stage+Phenotyping+of+Soybean+with+Multimodal+UAV+Sensor+Data%3A+A+Comparison+of+Machine+Learning+Approaches+for+Leaf+Area+Index+Estimation&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=1&spage=7&au=Zhang%2C+Yi%3BYang%2C+Yizhe%3BZhang%2C+Qinwei%3BDuan%2C+Runqing%3BLiu%2C+Junqi%3BQin%2C+Yuchu%3BWang%2C+Xianzhi&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15010007","Algorithms; Back propagation; China; Comparative studies; Corn; Crop growth; Crops; Flowering; Hyperspectral imaging; Leaf area; leaf area index; Leaf area index; Learning algorithms; Leaves; Lidar; machine learning; Machine learning; multi-source remote sensing; Neural networks; Phenotyping; Physics; prediction models; Prediction models; Predictions; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Remote sensors; Sensors; soybean; Soybean; Soybeans; Support vector machines; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Indonesian government needs to monitor mining activity to maintain environmental sustainability and the availability of mining materials in Indonesia. This study aims to map open mining areas based on remote sensing data. This mapping is one of the actions to support sustainable development goals for ensuring sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. This study was conducted in Central Bangka Regency, Bangka Belitung Island Province, Indonesia, using the multitemporal Sentinel-2 year of 2020-2021. Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix and Principal Component Analysis were applied to improve the input band capability in mapping the distribution of open-pit mining locations. A pixel-based machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, was applied to classify mining and non-mining. Classification using texture analysis and spectral transformation mapped an open mining area of 30.67 km2. Classification using only image bands resulted from a mining area of 18.38 km2. The assessment showed that texture analysis and spectral transformation provided an accuracy of 1.22 % higher than the classification using a direct image input band. Overall, the accuracy obtained by both methods was 96.93 % and 95.71 %. Further research on validation with high-resolution data is still needed.","2022-11","2024-01-16 09:03:50","2024-01-19 10:59:41","","012071","","1","1109","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2747924014","","","Place: Bristol Publisher: IOP Publishing","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/czlCQ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=nE0%2Bz8ya%2B8XABkMJdXg2w0sy4Dw%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=The+use+of+texture+analysis+and+band+transformation+on+multispectral+imagery+to+map+open-pit+mines+using+machine+learning&title=IOP+Conference+Series.+Earth+and+Environmental+Science&issn=17551307&date=2022-11-01&volume=1109&issue=1&spage=012071&au=Nugroho%2C+G%3BSofan%2C+P%3BNugroho%2C+U+C%3BPambudi%2C+A+I%3BYulianto%2C+F%3BIchsan%2C+N&isbn=&jtitle=IOP+Conference+Series.+Earth+and+Environmental+Science&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1088%2F1755-1315%2F1109%2F1%2F012071","Algorithms; Classification; Environmental Studies; Image classification; Indonesia; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Mining; Multispectral image; Multispectral imagery; Natural resources; Open pit mining; Open-pit mining; Principal components analysis; Remote sensing; Sustainability; Sustainability management; Sustainable development; Texture; Transformation; Transformations (mathematics)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, monitoring optically inactive WQPs, such as total nitrogen (TN), ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), and total phosphorus (TP) in inland waters, is still challenging. This study constructed retrieval models to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of TN, AN, and TP by Landsat 8 images, water quality sampling, and five machine learning algorithms (support vector regression, SVR; random forest regression, RFR; artificial neural networks, ANN; regression tree, RT; and gradient boosting machine, GBM) in the Nandu River downstream (NRD), a tropical river in China. The results indicated that these models can effectively monitor TN, AN, and TP concentrations at in situ sites. In particular, TN by RFR as well as AN and TP by ANN had better accuracy, in which the R2 value ranged between 0.44 and 0.67, and the RMSE was 0.03–0.33 mg/L in the testing dataset. The spatial distribution of TN, AN, and TP was seasonal in NRD from 2013–2022. TN and AN should be paid more attention to in normal wet seasons of urban and agricultural zones, respectively. TP, however, should be focus on in the normal season of agricultural zones. Temporally, AN decreased significantly in the normal and wet seasons while the others showed little change. These results could provide a large-scale spatial overview of the water quality, find the sensitive areas and periods of water pollution, and assist in identifying and controlling the non-point source pollution in the NRD. This study demonstrated that multispectral remote sensing and machine learning algorithms have great potential for monitoring optically inactive WQPs in tropical large-scale inland rivers.","2022","2024-01-16 09:03:50","2024-01-19 10:58:31","","5466","","21","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2771655118","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/341yQ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=ltXy9t8XuR4%2FWJVs69pw%2Frv9hBw%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Satellite+and+Machine+Learning+Monitoring+of+Optically+Inactive+Water+Quality+Variability+in+a+Tropical+River&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=21&spage=5466&au=Li%2C+Ning%3BNing%2C+Ziyu%3BChen%2C+Miao%3BWu%2C+Dongming%3BHao%2C+Chengzhi%3BZhang%2C+Donghui%3BBai%2C+Rui%3BLiu%2C+Huiran%3BChen%2C+Xin%3BLi%2C+Wei%3BZhang%2C+Wen%3BChen%2C+Yicheng%3BLi%2C+Qinfen%3BZhang%2C+Lifu&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14215466","Agriculture; Algorithms; ammoniacal nitrogen (AN); Artificial neural networks; China; Drinking water; Environmental monitoring; Eutrophication; Flow velocity; Freshwater resources; Hainan Island; Image quality; Inland waters; Laboratories; Landsat; Landsat satellites; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; multispectral remote sensing; Neural networks; Nitrogen; Nonpoint source pollution; optically inactive water quality monitoring; Phosphorus; Physics; Point source pollution; Pollution monitoring; Pollution sources; Precipitation; Rainy season; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; River; Rivers; Rural areas; Satellite; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Seasons; Spatial distribution; Support vector machines; Surface water; total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); tropical river; Urban agriculture; Water management; Water pollution; Water quality; Water resources; Water resources management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper reports on a study that combines optical and radar data to address the challenges of distinguishing mangrove stands in cloud-prone regions. The Google Earth Engine geospatial processing platform was used to extract multiple scenes of Landsat surface reflectance Tier 1 and synthetic aperture radar (C-band and L-band). The images were enhanced by creating a feature that removes clouds from the optical data and using speckle filters to remove noise from the radar data. The random forest algorithm proved to be a robust and accurate machine learning approach for mangrove classification and assessment. Classification was evaluated using three scenarios: classification of optical data only, classification of radar data only, and combination of optical and radar data. Our results revealed that the scenario that combines optical and radar data performed better. Further analysis showed that about 16.9% and 21% of mangrove and other vegetation/wetland cover were lost between 2009 and 2019. Whereas water body and bare land/built-up areas increased by 7% and 45%, respectively. Accuracy was evaluated based on the three scenarios. The overall accuracy of the 2019 classification was 98.9% (kappa coefficient = 0.979), 84.6% (kappa coefficient = 0.718), and 99.1% (kappa coefficient = 0.984), for classification of optical data only, classification of radar data only, and combination of optical and radar data, respectively. This study has revealed the potential to map mangroves correctly, enabling on-site conservation practices in the climate change environment.","2022","2024-01-16 09:03:50","2024-01-19 10:57:05","","16687","","24","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2756819838","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/fsANQ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=1S9hsqqdAZFXfsSrbPSTUylouls%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Quantifying+Mangrove+Extent+Using+a+Combination+of+Optical+and+Radar+Images+in+a+Wetland+Complex%2C+Western+Region%2C+Ghana&title=Sustainability&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=24&spage=16687&au=Aja%2C+Daniel%3BMiyittah%2C+Michael+K%3BAngnuureng%2C+Donatus+Bapentire&isbn=&jtitle=Sustainability&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsu142416687","Africa; algorithm; C band; Classification; Climate change; cloud cover; Cloud cover; Coastal zone; Coastal zone management; Coasts; Coefficients; Conservation practices; Datasets; decision trees; Ecosystems; Environmental Studies; Evaluation; Ghana; Google Earth; Image classification; Image enhancement; Land area; Land degradation; Landsat; Machine learning; Mangrove; Mangrove swamps; Mangroves; Mapping; NDVI; radar; Radar; Radar data; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic-aperture radar; tropical coastal zone; Tropical forests; Water bodies; Wetlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although previous studies have investigated the hyperspectral inversion of soil salinity using machine learning, only a few have been based on soil types. Moreover, agricultural fields can be improved based on the accurate estimation of the soil salinity, according to the soil type. We collected field data relating to six salinized soils, Haplic Solonchaks (HSK), Stagnic Solonchaks (SSK), Calcic Sonlonchaks (CSK), Fluvic Solonchaks (FSK), Haplic Sonlontzs (HSN), and Takyr Solonetzs (TSN), in the Hetao Plain of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and measured the in situ hyperspectral, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) values of a total of 231 soil samples. The two-dimensional spectral index, topographic factors, climate factors, and soil texture were considered. Several models were used for the inversion of the saline soil types: partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), extremely randomized trees (ERT), and ridge regression (RR). The spectral curves of the six salinized soil types were similar, but their reflectance sizes were different. The degree of salinization did not change according to the spectral reflectance of the soil types, and the related properties were inconsistent. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) between the two-dimensional spectral index and the EC was much greater than that between the reflectance and EC in the original band. In the two-dimensional index, the PCC of the HSK-NDI was the largest (0.97), whereas in the original band, the PCC of the SSK400 nm was the largest (0.70). The two-dimensional spectral index (NDI, RI, and DI) and the characteristic bands were the most selected variables in the six salinized soil types, based on the variable projection importance analysis (VIP). The best inversion model for the HSK and FSK was the RF, whereas the best inversion model for the CSK, SSK, HSN, and TSN was the ERT, and the CSK-ERT had the best performance (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.18, and RPIQ = 6.38). This study provides a reference for distinguishing various salinization types using hyperspectral reflectance and provides a foundation for the accurate monitoring of salinized soil via multispectral remote sensing.","2022","2024-01-16 09:03:51","2024-01-19 10:52:31","","5639","","22","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2739455922","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/phN1Q?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=46rvSE7aXOYHeNccIVSbjnhUN7g%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Inversion+of+Different+Cultivated+Soil+Types%26rsquo%3B+Salinity+Using+Hyperspectral+Data+and+Machine+Learning&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=22&spage=5639&au=Jia%2C+Pingping%3BZhang%2C+Junhua%3BHe%2C+Wei%3BDing%2C+Yuan%3BHu%2C+Yi%3BZamanian%2C+Kazem%3BJia%2C+Keli%3BZhao%2C+Xiaoning&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14225639","Accuracy; Agricultural land; Agricultural production; Agriculture; Alkalinity; China; Climate models; Correlation coefficient; Correlation coefficients; Decision trees; Desertification; Drainage; Electrical conductivity; Electrical resistivity; Environmental monitoring; Hetao Plain; Hyperspectral imaging; Inversion; Irrigation; Land use; Learning algorithms; Least squares method; Machine learning; Mongolia; Physics; Reflectance; Remote sensing; Saline soils; Salinity; Salinity effects; salinization; Salinization; Software; soil degradation; Soil degradation; soil electrical conductivity; Soil properties; soil quality; Soil salinity; Soil texture; Soil type; Soil types; Soils; Spectral index; Spectral reflectance; Spectrum analysis; Sustainable development; Texture; Tikhonov regularization; variable projection importance; Variables; Yellow River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flooding is the country’s most recurrent and impactful hazard among other natural hazards. This hazard alone, observed in many river basins, has been inflicting huge damages on livelihoods, social infrastructure, and the country’s economy. This study aims to review the current status of flood hazards, impacts, driving factors, management capacity, and future research directions on floods in Cambodia. The findings of this study suggested that there is still a lack of flood-related studies on flood hazard mapping, risk and damage assessment, and future flood analysis in Cambodia. The existing related studies mainly focused on the Tonle Sap Basin and its tributaries, the Lower Mekong Basin, the whole Mekong River Basin, and some of the tributaries of the Mekong River in Cambodia. The fundamental driving factors of the current flooding in Cambodia are impacts of climate change, land-use change, water infrastructure development, and weather extremes. The applications of mathematical and statistical tests and indices, conceptual and physically-based modeling, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and remote sensing are recommended to focus on future research directions on flood in Cambodia in the areas of land-use change, existing and planned operation of water infrastructure, flood hazard and damage assessment, and flood forecasting. The outcomes from these studies and applications would improve the understanding of flood hazard characteristics, reinforce flood management, and achieve flood damage reduction.","2022","2024-01-16 09:03:51","2024-01-19 10:45:39","","162","","11","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2734609954","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/Ex8EQ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=EcRKVo2TY9S8nPduMsbbOpWK%2F18%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Flood+Hazard+and+Management+in+Cambodia%3A+A+Review+of+Activities%2C+Knowledge+Gaps%2C+and+Research+Direction&title=Climate&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=10&issue=11&spage=162&au=Sophea+Rom+Phy%3BSok%2C+Ty%3BTry%2C+Sophal%3BChan%2C+Ratboren%3BUk%2C+Sovannara%3BHen%2C+Chhordaneath%3BOeurng%2C+Chantha&isbn=&jtitle=Climate&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fcli10110162","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Cambodia; Climate and land use; Climate change; Countries; Damage; Damage assessment; Datasets; driving factors; Drought; Environmental impact; Extreme weather; Fatalities; Flood; Flood analysis; Flood control; Flood damage; Flood forecasting; flood hazard; Flood hazards; Flood management; Flood mapping; Flooding; Floods; Hazards; Infrastructure; Land use; Laos; Livelihoods; Machine learning; Meteorology; Rain; Remote sensing; Research; Risk assessment; River basins; River discharge; River networks; Rivers; Seasons; Statistical analysis; Statistical tests; Storm damage; Thailand; Tributaries; United States--US; Vietnam; Vulnerability; Water supply systems; Wind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conceptually, LA is part of a global land management paradigm incorporating LA functions such as land value, land tenure, land development, and land use. The implementation of land-related policies integrated with well-maintained spatial information reflects the aim set by the United Nations to deliver tenure security for all (Sustainable Development Goal target 1.4, amongst many others). Innovative methods for data acquisition, processing, and maintaining spatial information are needed in response to the global challenges of urbanization and complex urban infrastructure. Current technological developments in remote sensing and geo-spatial information science provide enormous opportunities in this respect. Over the past decade, the increasing usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite and airborne-based acquisitions, as well as active remote sensing sensors such as LiDAR, resulted in high spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution data. Moreover, significant progress has also been achieved in automatic image orientation, surface reconstruction, scene analysis, change detection, classification, and automatic feature extraction with the help of artificial intelligence, spatial statistics, and machine learning. These technology developments, applied to LA, are now being actively demonstrated, piloted, and scaled.

The empirical knowledge obtained from post-event impact assessments provides crucial insights into the range of parameters controlling impact and recovery of vegetation, but their limited coverage in time and space offers a limited sample of all possible eruptive and environmental conditions. Consequently, vegetation vulnerability remains largely unconstrained, thus impeding quantitative risk analyses.Here, we explore how cloud-based big Earth observation data, remote sensing and interpretable machine learning (ML) can provide a large-scale alternative to identify the nature of, and infer relationships between, drivers controlling vegetation impact and recovery. We present a methodology developed using Google Earth Engine to systematically revisit the impact of past eruptions and constrain critical hazard and vulnerability parameters. Its application to the impact associated with the tephra fallout from the 2011 eruption of Cordón Caulle volcano (Chile) reveals its ability to capture different impact states as a function of hazard and environmental parameters and highlights feedbacks and thresholds controlling impact and recovery of both natural and cultivated vegetation. We therefore conclude that big Earth observation (EO) data and machine learning complement existing impact datasets and open the way to a new type of dynamic and large-scale vulnerability models.","2022","2024-01-16 09:03:52","2024-01-19 10:46:53","","2829-2855","","9","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2708096464","","","Place: Katlenburg-Lindau Publisher: Copernicus GmbH","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/yNH2O?_a=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%3D%3D&_s=2MsiiHITYYVUolVugFxT6ALo%2BP4%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Insights+into+the+vulnerability+of+vegetation+to+tephra+fallouts+from+interpretable+machine+learning+and+big+Earth+observation+data&title=Natural+Hazards+and+Earth+System+Sciences&issn=15618633&date=2022-01-01&volume=22&issue=9&spage=2829&au=Biass%2C+S%C3%A9bastien%3BJenkins%2C+Susanna+F%3BAeberhard%2C+William+H%3BDelmelle%2C+Pierre%3BWilson%2C+Thomas&isbn=&jtitle=Natural+Hazards+and+Earth+System+Sciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.5194%2Fnhess-22-2829-2022","Agriculture; Crops; Earth; Earth observation; Earth Sciences--Geophysics; Empirical analysis; Environmental conditions; Environmental factors; Environmental hazards; Environmental parameters; Eruptions; Fallout; Fertility; Food security; Google Earth; Hazards; Impact assessment; Investigations; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Observational learning; Parameters; Recovery; Remote observing; Remote sensing; Risk analysis; Soil fertility; Tephra; Vegetation; Volcanic activity; Volcanic eruption effects; Volcanic eruptions; Volcanic soils; Volcanoes; Vulnerability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite an abundance of NDVI review articles, these studies are predominantly limited to either one subject area or one area, with systematic NDVI reviews being relatively rare. Bibliometrics is a useful method of analyzing scientific literature that has been widely used in many disciplines; however, it has not yet been applied to comprehensively analyze NDVI research. Therefore, we used bibliometrics and scientific mapping methods to analyze citation data retrieved from the Web of Science during 1985–2021 with NDVI as the topic. According to the analysis results, the amount of NDVI research increased exponentially during the study period, and the related research fields became increasingly varied. Moreover, a greater number of satellite and aerial remote sensing platforms resulted in more diverse NDVI data sources. In future, machine learning methods and cloud computing platforms led by Google Earth Engine will substantially improve the accuracy and production efficiency of NDVI data products for more effective global research.","2022","2024-01-16 09:03:52","2024-01-19 10:30:22","","3967","","16","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2706285661","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/Ykk1O?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=1BFDCEk0JH%2FTUBjMLYR7Vni8uNQ%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Bibliometric+Analysis+of+Global+NDVI+Research+Trends+from+1985+to+2021&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=16&spage=3967&au=Xu%2C+Yang%3BYang%2C+Yaping%3BChen%2C+Xiaona%3BLiu%2C+Yangxiaoyue&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14163967","Agricultural production; Bibliometric; Bibliometrics; bibliometrix; Citation analysis; Citation indexes; Cloud computing; Data analysis; Data collection; Databases; Earth; Ecosystems; Google Earth; Keywords; Machine learning; Methods; NDVI; network analysis; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized difference vegetative index; Physics; remote sensing; Remote sensing; Research; Satellites; Scientometrics; Trends; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Vegetation; visualization; Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, residential buildings that were built with outdated standards usually face difficulty meeting current energy performance standards. The situation is especially common in Europe, as 35% of buildings were built over fifty years ago. Building retrofitting techniques provide a choice to improve building energy efficiency while maintaining the usable main structures, as opposed to demolition. The retrofit assessment requires the building stock information, including energy demand and material compositions. Therefore, understanding the building stock at scale becomes a critical demand. A significant piece of information is the building geometry, which is essential in building energy modelling and stock analysis. In this investigation, an approach has been developed to automatically measure building dimensions from remote sensing data. The approach is built on a combination of unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including K-means++, DBSCAN and RANSAC. This work is also the first attempt at using a vehicle-mounted data-capturing system to collect data as the input to characterise building geometry. The developed approach is tested on an automatically built and labelled point cloud model dataset of residential buildings and shows capability in acquiring comprehensive geometry information while keeping a high level of accuracy when processing an intact model.","2022","2024-01-16 09:03:52","2024-01-19 10:58:44","","6090","","16","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2706194206","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/bSX1O?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=ZMhV5IDFDfykZgjet8dgE6VtOOY%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Scalable+Residential+Building+Geometry+Characterisation+Using+Vehicle-Mounted+Camera+System&title=Energies&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=15&issue=16&spage=6090&au=Dai%2C+Menglin%3BWard%2C+Wil+O+C%3BArbabi%2C+Hadi%3BDanielle+Densley+Tingley%3BMayfield%2C+Martin&isbn=&jtitle=Energies&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fen15166090","building dimension measurement; building reconstruction; building stock; Buildings; Cameras; Climate change; Data collection; Datasets; DBSCAN; Emissions; Energy; Energy consumption; Energy demand; Energy efficiency; Geometry; Libraries; Performance standards; Photogrammetry; Random sample consensus; Remote sensing; Residential area; Residential areas; Residential building; Residential buildings; Residential energy; Retrofitting; Three dimensional models; United Kingdom--UK; Unmanned aerial vehicles; urban building energy modelling; Urban environments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amounts of ash and char are used to roughly evaluate the impacts of a fire on nutrient cycling and ecosystem recovery. Numerous studies have suggested that fire severity can be assessed by measuring changes in ash characteristics. Traditional methods to determine fire severity are based on in situ observations, and visual approximation of changes in the forest floor and soil which are both laborious and subjective. These measures primarily reflect the level of consumption of organic layers, the deposition of ash, particularly its depth and color, and fire-induced changes in the soil. Recent studies suggested adding remote sensing techniques to the field observations and using machine learning and spectral indices to assess the effects of fires on ecosystems. While index thresholding can be easily implemented, its effectiveness over large areas is limited to pattern coverage of forest type and fire regimes. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, allow multivariate classifications, but learning is complex and time-consuming when analyzing space-time series. Therefore, there is currently no consensus regarding a quantitative index of fire severity. Considering that wildfires play a major role in controlling forest carbon storage and cycling in fire-suppressed forests, this study examines the use of low-cost multispectral imagery across visible and near-infrared regions collected by unmanned aerial systems to determine fire severity according to the color and chemical properties of vegetation ash. The use of multispectral imagery data might reduce the lack of precision that is part of manual color matching and produce a vast and accurate spatio-temporal severity map. The suggested severity map is based on spectral information used to evaluate chemical/mineralogical changes by deep learning algorithms. These methods quantify total carbon content and assess the corresponding fire intensity that is required to form a particular residue. By designing three learning algorithms (PLS-DA, ANN, and 1-D CNN) for two datasets (RGB images and Munsell color versus Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-based multispectral imagery) the multispectral prediction results were excellent. Therefore, deep network-based near-infrared remote sensing technology has the potential to become an alternative reliable method to assess fire severity.","2022","2024-01-16 09:03:52","2024-01-19 10:59:55","","3632","","15","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2700767100","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/WotrN?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=UGMs8Mh0h9DhxhxlLN%2BWENC2N9w%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Total+Carbon+Content+Assessed+by+UAS+Near-Infrared+Imagery+as+a+New+Fire+Severity+Metric&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=15&spage=3632&au=Brook%2C+Anna%3BHamzi%2C+Seham%3BRoberts%2C+Dar%3BIchoku%2C+Charles%3BShtober-Zisu%2C+Nurit%3BWittenberg%2C+Lea&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14153632","Algorithms; Ash; Ashes; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon content; Carbon cycle; Carbon sequestration; Chemical properties; Color; Color imagery; Color matching; Cycles; Deep learning; Discriminant analysis; Ecosystem recovery; Evaluation; fire severity; Forest & brush fires; Forest fires; Forest floor; Forests; I.R. radiation; Image processing; Infrared imagery; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Mapping; Multispectral imagery; Nitrogen; Nutrient cycles; Physics; post-fire environment; Remote sensing; Sensors; Soils; spectral model; Topography; total carbon; Total carbon; unmanned aerial system multispectral imagery; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Vegetation; Visual observation; Wildfire; Wildfires","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The precise classification of crop types is of great significance to the monitoring and evaluation of crops planting area, growth, and yield. Based on the Google Earth Engine and Google Colab cloud platform, this study takes the typical agricultural oasis area of Xiangride Town, Qinghai Province, as an example. It compares traditional machine learning (random forest, RF), object-oriented classification (object-oriented, OO), and deep neural networks (DNN), which proposes a random forest combined with deep neural network (RF+DNN) classification framework. In this study, the spatial characteristics of band information, vegetation index, and polarization of main crops in the study area were constructed using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The temporal characteristics of crops phenology and growth state were analyzed using the curve curvature method, and the data were screened in time and space. By comparing and analyzing the accuracy of the four classification methods, the advantages of RF+DNN model and its application value in crops classification were illustrated. The results showed that for the crops in the study area during the period of good growth and development, a better crop classification result could be obtained using RF+DNN classification method, whose model accuracy, training, and predict time spent were better than that of using DNN alone. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of classification were 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. It is also higher than the classification accuracy of random forest (OA = 0.87, Kappa = 0.82), object oriented (OA = 0.78, Kappa = 0.70) and deep neural network (OA = 0.93, Kappa = 0.90). The scalable and simple classification method proposed in this paper gives full play to the advantages of cloud platform in data and operation, and the traditional machine learning combined with deep learning can effectively improve the classification accuracy. Timely and accurate extraction of crop types at different spatial and temporal scales is of great significance for crops pattern change, crops yield estimation, and crops safety warning.","2022","2024-01-16 09:03:52","2024-01-19 10:59:22","","2758","","12","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2679852345","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/JLRMN?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=4fybf9R4K5zKe5Rg3pAaMcZVPAk%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=The+Classification+Method+Study+of+Crops+Remote+Sensing+with+Deep+Learning%2C+Machine+Learning%2C+and+Google+Earth+Engine&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=12&spage=2758&au=Yao%2C+Jinxi%3BWu%2C+Ji%3BXiao%2C+Chengzhi%3BZhang%2C+Zhi%3BLi%2C+Jianzhong&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14122758","Accuracy; Agriculture; Algorithms; Artificial neural networks; Classification; Crop yield; Crops; crops classification; Data processing; deep learning; Deep learning; Google Colab; Google Earth; Google Earth Engine; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Model accuracy; Neural networks; Object-oriented programming; Performance evaluation; Physics; Precipitation; Random forest; Remote sensing; Rice; River networks; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Sugarcane; Support vector machines; Time series; Vegetation; Vegetation index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Observing land-surface parameters in the field is one of the key steps of validation. Therefore, the demand for long-term stable validation stations has gradually increased. However, the current location-selection procedure of validation stations lacks a systematic and objective evaluation system. In this research, a data-driven selection of a land product validation station (DSS-LPV) based on Machine Learning is proposed. Firstly, we construct an evaluation indicator system in which all factors affecting the location of validation stations are divided into surface characteristics, atmospheric conditions and the social environment. Then, multi-scale evaluation grids are constructed and indicators are allocated for spatial evaluation. Finally, four Machine Learning (ML) methods are used to learn the established reliable stations, and different data-driven scoring models are constructed to explore the intrinsic relationship between evaluation indicators and station locations. In this article, the reliability of DSS-LPV is effectively validated by the example of China using the national-level land product validation station that has been established. After a comparison between the four ML models, the random forest (RF) with the highest accuracy was selected as the modeling method of DSS-LPV. The correlation between the regression value of test stations and the target value is 0.9133. The average score of test stations is 0.8304. The test stations are generally located within the calculated hot-spot area of the score density map, which means that it is highly consistent with the location of the built stations. Research results indicate that DSS-LPV is an effective method that can provide a reasonable geographical distribution of the stations. The location-selection results can provide scientific decision-making support for the construction of land product validation stations.","2022","2024-01-16 09:03:53","2024-01-19 10:41:25","","813","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Coronavirus Research Database; Publicly Available Content Database","2633146174","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/AYmDM?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=zjguDWNubxsUzUN8WDDQHj2C97c%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Data-Driven+Selection+of+Land+Product+Validation+Station+Based+on+Machine+Learning&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=4&spage=813&au=Li%2C+Ruoxi%3BTao%2C+Zui%3BZhou%2C+Xiang%3BLv%2C+Tingting%3BWang%2C+Jin%3BXie%2C+Futai%3BZhai%2C+Mingjian&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14040813","Atmospheric conditions; Atmospheric models; China; Cooperation; data-driven; Decision making; Decision trees; Environmental monitoring; Evaluation; Geographical distribution; Indicators; Land; land product validation station; Learning algorithms; location selection; machine learning; Machine learning; Physics; Random forest; Reliability analysis; Remote observing; Remote sensing; Research; Satellites; Scoring models; Site selection; Social environment; Surface properties; Sustainable development; Validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is therefore important to preserve and protect these species. Coral and seagrass percent cover mapping is a simple approach to assess coral and seagrass condition. The application of remote sensing of coral and seagrass percent cover mapping is very challenging with respect to performance and accuracy. This research aims to utilize remote sensing data for coral and seagrass percent cover mapping. Linear and machine learning regressions (RF and SVM) were used to develop a coral and seagrass percent cover model from a Sentinel-2 MSI images. The Sentinel-2 MSI images were transformed into deglint, water column (DII), principal component, and mean texture analysis as input bands for the model. The results showed that coral percent cover mapping accuracy is relatively low (RMSE = ±17%) due to various problems, limitations, and an inaccurate model, whereas the results of the seagrass percent cover map had higher accuracy, with RMSE ±11%. The results obtained indicate that the seagrass percent cover map is suitable for use as basic information to support coastal management. However, the coral percent cover map is not an optimal information source due to its low accuracy.","2021-03","2024-01-16 09:03:53","2024-01-19 10:57:35","","","","1","686","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2511503892","","","Place: Bristol Publisher: IOP Publishing","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/4Z1lI?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=k4wzFl4%2BFKOeSirFOaIYIqdbXDI%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=proceeding&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Remote+sensing+for+coral+reef+and+seagrass+cover+mapping+to+support+coastal+management+of+small+islands&title=IOP+Conference+Series.+Earth+and+Environmental+Science&issn=17551307&date=2021-03-01&volume=686&issue=1&spage=&au=Lazuardi%2C+W%3BWicaksono%2C+P%3BMarfai%2C+M+A&isbn=&jtitle=IOP+Conference+Series.+Earth+and+Environmental+Science&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1088%2F1755-1315%2F686%2F1%2F012031","Accuracy; Biodiversity; Coastal environments; Coastal fisheries; Coastal management; Coastal resources; Coastal zone management; Coral reef; Coral reefs; Environmental protection; Environmental Studies; Fisheries; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Protected species; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Resource management; Seagrass; Tourism; Water circulation; Water column","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as tracking and mapping, geospatial analysis, remote sensing techniques, robotics, drone technology, machine learning, telecom and network services, accident and hot spot analysis, smart city urban planning, transportation planning, and environmental impact analysis, are the technological components of societal change, having significant implications for research on the societal response to hazards and disasters. Social science researchers have used various technologies and methods to examine hazards and disasters through disciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary lenses. They have employed both quantitative and qualitative data collection and data analysis strategies. This study provides an overview of the current applications of AI in disaster management during its four phases and how AI is vital to all disaster management phases, leading to a faster, more concise, equipped response. Integrating a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) into disaster management enables higher planning, analysis, situational awareness, and recovery operations. GIS and RS are commonly recognized as key support tools for disaster management.

The purpose of this study was to generate and compare management zones (MZ) based on the Sentinel-2 satellite data for variable rate application of mineral nitrogen in wheat production, calculated using different remote sensing (RS)-based models under varied soil, yield and crop data availability. Three models were applied, including (1) a modified “RS- and threshold-based clustering”, (2) a “hybrid-based, unsupervised clustering”, in which data from different sources were combined for MZ delineation, and (3) a “RS-based, unsupervised clustering”. Various data processing methods including machine learning were used in the model development. Statistical tests such as the Paired Sample T-test, Kruskal–Wallis H-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were applied to evaluate the final delineated MZ maps. Additionally, a procedure for improving models based on information about phenological phases and the occurrence of agricultural drought was implemented. The results showed that information on agronomy and climate enables improving and optimizing MZ delineation. The integration of prior knowledge on new climate conditions (drought) in image selection was tested for effective use of the models. Lack of this information led to the infeasibility of obtaining optimal results. Models that solely rely on remote sensing information are comparatively less expensive than hybrid models. Additionally, remote sensing-based models enable delineating MZ for fertilizer recommendations that are temporally closer to fertilization times.","2021","2024-01-16 09:03:54","2024-01-19 10:58:57","","1104","","11","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2601974482","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/w8AbL?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=uoYuyJy%2BOsMJVFzm0Pf36qt76DU%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Simplified+and+Hybrid+Remote+Sensing-Based+Delineation+of+Management+Zones+for+Nitrogen+Variable+Rate+Application+in+Wheat&title=Agriculture&issn=&date=2021-01-01&volume=11&issue=11&spage=1104&au=Rokhafrouz%2C+Mohammad%3BLatifi%2C+Hooman%3BAbkar%2C+Ali+A%3BWojciechowski%2C+Tomasz%3BCzechlowski%2C+Miros%C5%82aw%3BAli+Sadeghi+Naieni%3BMaghsoudi%2C+Yasser%3BNiedba%C5%82a%2C+Gniewko&isbn=&jtitle=Agriculture&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fagriculture11111104","Agricultural drought; Agricultural production; Agriculture; Agronomy; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Climatic conditions; clustering; Clustering; Crop production; Crop yield; Data processing; Delineation; digital agriculture; drought; Drought; Farmers; Farms; Fertilization; Fertilizers; Information systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; management zones; Mathematical models; Model testing; Nitrogen; Optimization; Precipitation; precision agriculture; Precision agriculture; Precision farming; Radiation; Rank tests; remote sensing; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sentinel-2; Spatial data; Statistical analysis; Statistical tests; Sustainable development; Vegetation; Wheat; winter wheat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A recent study has shown that up to 80% of the population of some cities in Africa fall under the poverty line. Other studies have shown that poverty is one of the main contributors to residents’ poor health and social conflict. Reducing the number of people living in poverty and improving their living conditions have become some of the main tasks for many nations and international organizations. On the other hand, urban gentrification has been taking place in the poor neighborhoods of all major cities in the world. Although gentrification can reduce the poverty rate and increase the GDP and tax revenue of cities and potentially bring opportunities for poor communities, it displaces the original residents of the neighborhoods, negatively impacting their living and access to social services. In order to support the sustainable development of cities and communities and improve residents’ welfare, it is essential to identify the location, scale, and dynamics of urban poverty and gentrification, and remote sensing can play a key role in this. This paper reviews, summarizes, and evaluates state-of-the-art approaches for identifying and mapping urban poverty and gentrification with remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning techniques. It also discusses the pros and cons of remote sensing approaches in comparison with traditional approaches. With remote sensing approaches, both spatial and temporal resolutions for the identification of poverty and gentrification have been dramatically increased, while the economic cost is significantly reduced.","2021","2024-01-16 09:03:54","2024-01-19 10:58:01","","4022","","20","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Coronavirus Research Database; Publicly Available Content Database","2584518865","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/i0N0L?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=OSLKFtnEZS2wlceO8aCw%2Fl3k6S0%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Remote+Sensing+of+Urban+Poverty+and+Gentrification&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2021-01-01&volume=13&issue=20&spage=4022&au=Li%2C+Lin%3BDi%2C+Liping%3BZhang%2C+Chen%3BGuo%2C+Liying%3BDi%2C+Yahui&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs13204022","20th century; 21st century; Africa; Cities; COVID-19; Developing countries--LDCs; Economic activity; Economic impact; gentrification; Gentrification; Health insurance; Households; Industrialized nations; International organizations; Learning algorithms; Living conditions; Low income areas; Low income groups; machine learning; Machine learning; Neighborhoods; Physics; Population; Population growth; Poverty; remote sensing; Remote sensing; Social services; Society; State-of-the-art reviews; Sustainable development; Taxation; United States--US; Urban; Urban area; Urban areas; urban poverty; Urban poverty; Urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the distribution and condition of tropical forests are under significant pressure, causing shrinkage and risking biodiversity loss across the tropics. Tanzania is currently undergoing significant forest cover changes, but monitoring is limited, in part due to a lack of remote sensing knowledge, tools and methods. This study has demonstrated a comprehensive approach to creating a national-scale forest monitoring system using Earth Observation data to inform decision making, policy formulation, and combat biodiversity loss. A systematically wall-to-wall forest baseline was created for 2018 through the application of Landsat 8 imagery. The classification was developed using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine-learning algorithm, and achieved an accuracy of 89% and identified 45.76% of the country’s area to be covered with forest. Of those forested areas, 45% was found within nationally protected areas. Utilising an innovative methodology based on a forest habitat suitability analysis, the forest baseline was classified into forest types, with an overall accuracy of 85%. Woodlands (open and closed) were found to make up 79% of Tanzania’s forests. To map changes in forest extent, an automated system for downloading and processing of the Landsat imagery was used along with the XGBoost classifiers trained to define the national forest extent, where Landsat 8 scenes were individually downloaded and processed and the identified changes summarised on an annual basis. Forest loss identified for 2019 was found to be 157,204 hectares, with an overall accuracy of 82%.

Therefore, a forest monitoring system, such as the one presented in this study, will enhance conservation programmes and support efforts to save the last remnants of Tanzania’s pristine forests.","2021","2024-01-16 09:03:54","2024-01-19 10:26:02","","3081","","16","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2565700180","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/RQS8M?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=Y2Y14ZOaqOxCCyXOx8%2FSuKvuo6s%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=A+Forest+Monitoring+System+for+Tanzania&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2021-01-01&volume=13&issue=16&spage=3081&au=Elikana%2C+John%3BBunting%2C+Pete%3BHardy%2C+Andy%3BDos+Santos+Silayo%3BMasunga%2C+Edgar&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs13163081","Africa; Algorithms; Biodiversity; Biodiversity loss; change detection; Classification; Climate change; Data processing; Datasets; Decision making; deforestation; Deforestation; Ecosystem services; Forest; forest baseline; Forest ecosystems; forest types; Forests; Image classification; Landsat; Landsat 8; Landsat satellites; Landsat-8; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Monitoring; Monitoring systems; Physics; Precipitation; protected areas; Protected areas; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Software; Tanzania; Topography; Tropical environments; Tropical forest; tropical forests; Tropical forests; Woodlands; XGBoost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The physical hydrologic models of flash flood prediction of any large area is very difficult to compute as it requires lot of data and time. Therefore remote sensing data based models (from statistical to machine learning) have become highly popular due to open data access and lesser prediction times. There is a continuous effort to improve the prediction accuracy of these models through introducing new methods. This study is focused on flash flood modeling through novel hybrid machine learning models, which can improve the prediction accuracy. The hybrid machine learning ensemble approaches that combine the three meta-classifiers (Real AdaBoost, Random Subspace, and MultiBoosting) with J48 (a tree-based algorithm that can be used to evaluate the behavior of the attribute vector for any defined number of instances) were used in the Gorganroud River Basin of Iran to assess flood susceptibility (FS). A total of 426 flood positions as dependent variables and a total of 14 flood conditioning factors (FCFs) as independent variables were used to model the FS. Several threshold-dependent and independent statistical tests were applied to verify the performance and predictive capability of these machine learning models, such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the success rate curve (SRC) and prediction rate curve (PRC), efficiency (E), root-mean square-error (RMSE), and true skill statistics (TSS). The valuation of the FCFs was done using AdaBoost, frequency ratio (FR), and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models. In the flooding of the study area, altitude, land use/land cover (LU/LC), distance to stream, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and rainfall played important roles. The Random Subspace J48 (RSJ48) ensemble method with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931 (SRC), 0.951 (PRC), E of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.87, and TSS of 0.78, has become the most effective ensemble in predicting the FS. The FR technique also showed good performance and reliability for all models. Map removal sensitivity analysis (MRSA) revealed that the FS maps have the highest sensitivity to elevation. Based on the findings of the validation methods, the FS maps prepared using the machine learning ensemble techniques have high robustness and can be used to advise flood management initiatives in flood-prone areas.","2020","2024-01-16 09:03:55","2024-01-19 10:55:19","","3423","","20","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2550312496","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/cbOtJ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=eTxfUSn2Q8OVIoZrLsdJuNePQQg%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Modeling+Spatial+Flood+using+Novel+Ensemble+Artificial+Intelligence+Approaches+in+Northern+Iran&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2020-01-01&volume=12&issue=20&spage=3423&au=Arabameri%2C+Alireza%3BSaha%2C+Sunil%3BMukherjee%2C+Kaustuv%3BBlaschke%2C+Thomas%3BChen%2C+Wei%3BPhuong+Thao+Thi+Ngo%3BBand%2C+Shahab+S&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs12203423","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Caspian Sea; Decision trees; Dependent variables; Drug resistance; Elevation; ensemble machine learning; Flash flood; Flash floods; Flood; Flood control; Flood damage; flood hazard susceptibility; Flood management; Flood predictions; Flooding; Floods; Gene mapping; Gorganroud River Basin; Hydrologic models; Hydrology; Independent variables; Iran; Land cover; Land use; Landslides & mudslides; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mathematical models; Model accuracy; Modelling; Performance prediction; Physics; Precipitation; Predictions; Rainfall; Regression analysis; Reliability analysis; Remote sensing; River basins; Root-mean-square errors; Sensitivity analysis; Statistical analysis; Statistical tests; Storm damage; Sustainable development; Topography; validation; Watersheds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, single data and method seem inadequate for conducting a scientific, effective, and innovative sustainable evaluation of complex community units. In this study, we perform a sustainable-oriented land use scheme using multisource remote sensing, machine learning, and object-based postclassification refinement. Furthermore, we assess the sustainability of the traffic community by data-driven and combined housing, ecosystem services, and landscape configuration. The results indicated that (1) the relationship between housing, ecosystem services, and landscape pattern has obvious synergistic effects, although with dissimilar importance in different sustainability levels. High sustainability level is intensely coordinated with landscape configuration, medium sustainability level is more affected by ecosystem services, and low sustainability level is more related to housing. (2) Community sustainability presents a significant spatial distribution. The communities of high sustainability level are mainly located in both sides of the Pearl River and emerging urban areas, while those of medium sustainability level are distributed sporadically in the study area and those of low sustainability level are concentrated in old towns. (3) Community transformation cannot be accomplished at one step. Along with the continuous optimization of landscape configuration, the priority should be given to housing reconstruction and improvement of ecosystem services further. We provide scientific and effective data-based evidence for urban decision-makers by integrating the advantages of the Earth Observation System and multifactor analysis.","2020","2024-01-16 09:03:55","2024-01-19 10:44:33","","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","2440435175","","","Place: Hoboken Publisher: Hindawi Limited","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/hJcDH?_a=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&_s=OrKZN45nqs5vARmgFdA%2BUaBwnSk%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3A&atitle=Evaluating+Urban+Community+Sustainability+by+Integrating+Housing%2C+Ecosystem+Services%2C+and+Landscape+Configuration&title=Complexity&issn=10762787&date=2020-01-01&volume=2020&issue=&spage=&au=Zhou%2C+Liang%3BMu%2C+Haowei%3BWang%2C+Bao%3BYuan%2C+Bo%3BDang%2C+Xuewei&isbn=&jtitle=Complexity&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1155%2F2020%2F3460962","China; Cities; Configurations; Decision making; Ecosystems; Environmental economics; Environmental impact; Evaluation; Housing; Land use; Machine learning; Mathematics; Optimization; Remote sensing; Residential community; Spatial distribution; Support vector machines; Sustainable development; Urban areas; Urban planning","","Jun Yang","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, recent studies are increasingly recognising passively crowdsourced geotagged photographs retrieved from location-based social media as suitable data for quantitative mapping and assessment of cultural ecosystem service (CES) flow. In this study, we attempt to improve CES mapping from geotagged photographs by combining natural language processing, i.e., topic modelling and automated machine learning classification. Our study focuses on three main groups of CESs that are abundant in outdoor social media data: landscape watching, active outdoor recreation, and wildlife watching. Moreover, by means of a comparative viewshed analysis, we compare the geographic information system- and remote sensing-based landscape organisation metrics related to landscape coherence and colour harmony. We observed the spatial distribution of CESs in Estonia and confirmed that colour harmony indices are more strongly associated with landscape watching and outdoor recreation, while landscape coherence is more associated with wildlife watching. Both CES use and values of landscape organisation indices are land cover-specific. The suggested methodology can significantly improve the state-of-the-art with regard to CES mapping from geotagged photographs, and it is therefore particularly relevant for monitoring landscape sustainability.","2020","2024-01-16 09:03:55","2024-01-19 10:56:12","","158","","5","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2406233089","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/lncaG?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=%2FjTjpkscc3x3%2FJhDJvpzxDLxQkY%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=On+How+Crowdsourced+Data+and+Landscape+Organisation+Metrics+Can+Facilitate+the+Mapping+of+Cultural+Ecosystem+Services%3A+An+Estonian+Case+Study&title=Land&issn=&date=2020-01-01&volume=9&issue=5&spage=158&au=Karasov%2C+Oleksandr%3BHeremans%2C+Stien%3BK%C3%BClvik%2C+Mart%3BDomnich%2C+Artem%3BChervanyov%2C+Igor&isbn=&jtitle=Land&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fland9050158","Algorithms; Application programming interface; automated image recognition; Automation; Classification; Coherence; Color; colour harmony; Conservation; Crowdsourcing; cultural ecosystem services; Digital media; Ecosystem assessment; Ecosystem service; Ecosystem services; Ecosystems; Estonia; Geographic information systems; Land cover; Land use; Landscape; landscape coherence; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Metadata; natural language processing; Natural language processing; New York; Outdoors; Photographs; Recreation; Remote sensing; Social networks; Spatial distribution; Studies; Sustainability; topic modelling; United States--US; Wildlife","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research is applying regression types of machine learning for semivariogram fitting to interpolate DEM. Previous research conducted was LS-SVM (Least Square-Support Vector Machine) and SVR (Support Vector Regression) for semivariogram fitting process. Types of SVM and GPR (Gaussian Process Regression) are adopted for semivariogram fitting for ordinary kriging interpolation in this experiment. The result showed that in general SVM types could predict accuracy better than other types of regression, and GPR types produce better DEM accuracy based on the experiment.","2019-08","2024-01-16 09:03:55","2024-01-19 10:58:52","","","","1","311","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2557882034","","","Place: Bristol Publisher: IOP Publishing","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/WOh7K?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=PHjS2vhfJvv6btcmbWiUI3kQqgo%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Semivariogram+fitting+based+on+SVM+and+GPR+for+DEM+interpolation&title=IOP+Conference+Series.+Earth+and+Environmental+Science&issn=17551307&date=2019-08-01&volume=311&issue=1&spage=&au=Setiyoko%2C+A%3BArymurthy%2C+A+M%3BBasaruddin%2C+T%3BArief%2C+R&isbn=&jtitle=IOP+Conference+Series.+Earth+and+Environmental+Science&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1088%2F1755-1315%2F311%2F1%2F012076","Digital Elevation Models; Earth surface; Environmental Studies; Gaussian process; Kriging interpolation; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Regression; Remote sensing; Stochastic processes; Stochasticity; Support vector machines; Variogram","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soil reflectance spectroscopy has been applied in various domains apart from laboratory conditions, e.g., sensors mounted on satellites, aircrafts and Unmanned Aerial Systems. The aim of this review is to illustrate the research made for soil organic carbon estimation, with the use of RS techniques, reporting the methodology and results of each study. It also aims to provide a comprehensive introduction in soil spectroscopy for those who are less conversant with the subject. In total, 28 journal articles were selected and further analysed. It was observed that prediction accuracy reduces from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) to satellite platforms, though advances in machine learning techniques could further assist in the generation of better calibration models. There are some challenges concerning atmospheric, radiometric and geometric corrections, vegetation cover, soil moisture and roughness that still need to be addressed. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are highlighted and future considerations are also discussed at the end.","2019-02","2024-01-16 09:03:55","2024-01-19 10:58:07","","","","6","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2304012558","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/Ye4nB?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=xeNbiqkGP%2FI4eaYitRAgZgm1zu0%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Remote+Sensing+Techniques+for+Soil+Organic+Carbon+Estimation%3A+A+Review&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2019-02-01&volume=11&issue=6&spage=&au=Angelopoulou%2C+Theodora%3BTziolas%2C+Nikolaos%3BBalafoutis%2C+Athanasios%3BZalidis%2C+George%3BBochtis%2C+Dionysis&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs11060676","Atmospheric models; Calibration; Carbon; Climate change; Domains; earth observation; Environmental monitoring; Greece; Laboratories; Learning algorithms; Loam soils; machine learning; Machine learning; Organic carbon; Organic soils; Physics; Reflectance; Remote sensing; Research; Satellites; Sensors; Short wave radiation; Soil carbon; Soil moisture; soil organic carbon; Soil sciences; soil spectroscopy; Soils; Spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Sustainable development; SWIR; Total organic carbon; Trends; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Vegetation cover; VNIR; VNIR–SWIR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is therefore timely to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas: mainstreaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the global scale.Alternate abstract:Technical summaryCities have an increasingly integral role in addressing climate change. To gain a common understanding of solutions, we require adequate and representative data of urban areas, including data on related greenhouse gas emissions, climate threats and of socio-economic contexts. Here, we review the current state of urban data science in the context of climate change, investigating the contribution of urban metabolism studies, remote sensing, big data approaches, urban economics, urban climate and weather studies. We outline three routes for upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions: 1) Mainstreaming and harmonizing data collection in cities worldwide; 2) Exploiting big data and machine learning to scale solutions while maintaining privacy; 3) Applying computational techniques and data science methods to analyse published qualitative information for the systematization and understanding of first-order climate effects and solutions. Collaborative efforts towards a joint data platform and integrated urban services would provide the quantitative foundations of the emerging global urban sustainability science.","2019","2024-01-16 09:03:55","2024-01-19 11:00:35","","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2353961679","","","Place: Cambridge Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/CJzWE?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=2NU5rp0JQBWjCVc1FDTNwKObeyA%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Upscaling+urban+data+science+for+global+climate+solutions&title=Global+Sustainability&issn=&date=2019-01-01&volume=2&issue=&spage=&au=Creutzig%2C+Felix%3BLohrey%2C+Steffen%3BBai%2C+Xuemei%3BBaklanov%2C+Alexander%3BDawson%2C+Richard%3BDhakal%2C+Shobhakar%3BLamb%2C+William+F%3BMcPhearson%2C+Timon%3BMinx%2C+Jan%3BMunoz%2C+Esteban%3BWalsh%2C+Brenna&isbn=&jtitle=Global+Sustainability&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1017%2Fsus.2018.16","Accounting; adaptation and mitigation; Big data; Big Data; Case studies; Cities; Climate; Climate change; Climate effects; Commuting; Computer applications; Data analysis; Data collection; Data science; Digital media; Earth observation; Emissions; Emissions control; Environmental policy; Environmental Studies; Global climate; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Industrial plant emissions; Information systems; Infrastructure; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mainstreaming; Measures; Metabolism; Open systems; policies; politics and governance; Qualitative analysis; Remote sensing; Researchers; Science; Social media; State-of-the-art reviews; Supply chains; Sustainability; Sustainability science; Urban; Urban area; Urban areas; Urban climate; Urban economics; urban systems; Weather","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To cope and manage this situation, monitoring spatial and temporal dynamics of the irrigated area land use at basin level is needed to ensure proper allocation of water. Publicly available satellite data at high spatial resolution and advances in remote sensing techniques offer a viable opportunity. In this study, we developed a new approach using time series of Landsat 8 (L8) data and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm by introducing a hierarchical post-processing scheme to extract key Land Use Land Cover (LULC) types. We implemented this approach for Mashhad basin in Iran to develop a LULC map at 15 m spatial resolution with nine classes for the crop year 2015/2016. In addition, five irrigated land use types were extracted for three crop years—2013/2014, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016—using the RF models. The total irrigated area was estimated at 1796.16 km2, 1581.7 km2 and 1578.26 km2 for the cropping years 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2015/2016, respectively. The overall accuracy of the final LULC map was 87.2% with a kappa coefficient of 0.85. The methodology was implemented using open data and open source libraries. The ability of the RF models to extract key LULC types at basin level shows the usability of such approaches for operational near real time monitoring.","2019-01","2024-01-16 09:03:56","2024-01-19 10:54:45","","","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2303995960","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/TJx8C?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=y6%2FbWXaT4S%2Fow5bP%2FBvZ7F0h8BY%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Mapping+Agricultural+Landuse+Patterns+from+Time+Series+of+Landsat+8+Using+Random+Forest+Based+Hierarchial+Approach&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2019-01-01&volume=11&issue=5&spage=&au=Pareeth%2C+Sajid%3BKarimi%2C+Poolad%3BShafiei%2C+Mojtaba%3BDe+Fraiture%2C+Charlotte&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs11050601","Agricultural land; Agricultural management; Agricultural production; agriculture; Agriculture; Algorithms; Arid regions; Arid zones; Basins; Classification; Crops; Decision making; Decision trees; Food production; Iran; irrigated area; Irrigated land; Irrigated lands; Irrigation; Land cover; Land use; Landsat; Landsat 8; Landsat satellites; landuse; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Maps; Mashhad; Monitoring; Monitoring systems; Netherlands; Physics; Post-production processing; Productivity; Random forest; Random Forest; remote sensing; Remote sensing; Satellites; Semi arid areas; Semiarid lands; Spatial data; Spatial discrimination; Spatial resolution; Studies; Time series; United States--US; Water resources; Water resources management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, we exploited the synergy of monthly mean and daily post processed satellite remote sensing observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations utilizing machine learning, in conjunction with 1-day forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). As cloudy conditions in this region are rare, aerosols in particular dust, are the most common sources of solar irradiance attenuation, causing performance issues in the photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) plant installations. The proposed EO-based methodology is based on the solar energy nowcasting system (SENSE) that quantifies the impact of aerosol and dust on solar energy potential by using the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in terms of climatological values and day-to-day monitoring and forecasting variability from MODIS and CAMS, respectively. The forecast accuracy was evaluated at various locations in Egypt with substantial PV and CSP capacity installed and found to be within 5–12% of that obtained from the satellite observations, highlighting the ability to use such modelling approaches for solar energy management and planning (M&P). Particulate matter resulted in attenuation by up to 64–107 kWh/m2 for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and 192–329 kWh/m2 for direct normal irradiance (DNI) annually. This energy reduction is climatologically distributed between 0.7% and 12.9% in GHI and 2.9% to 41% in DNI with the maximum values observed in spring following the frequent dust activity of Khamaseen. Under extreme dust conditions the AOD is able to exceed 3.5 resulting in daily energy losses of more than 4 kWh/m2 for a 10 MW system. Such reductions are able to cause financial losses that exceed the daily revenue values. This work aims to show EO capabilities and techniques to be incorporated and utilized in solar energy studies and applications in sun-privileged locations with permanent aerosol sources such as Egypt.","2018-12","2024-01-16 09:03:56","2024-01-19 10:43:10","","","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2303929573","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/pclmB?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=WPH4VK%2BfXWMfNm2DAu5tkGzyf5I%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Earth-Observation-Based+Estimation+and+Forecasting+of+Particulate+Matter+Impact+on+Solar+Energy+in+Egypt&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2018-12-01&volume=10&issue=12&spage=&au=Kosmopoulos%2C+Panagiotis+G%3BKazadzis%2C+Stelios%3BEl-Askary%2C+Hesham%3BTaylor%2C+Michael%3BGkikas%2C+Antonis%3BProestakis%2C+Emmanouil%3BKontoes%2C+Charalampos%3BMohamed+Mostafa+El-Khayat&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs10121870","aerosol impact; Aerosols; Alternative energy sources; Atmosphere; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric models; Atmospheric monitoring; Attenuation; Cairo Egypt; Climate change; Climatology; Computer simulation; Dust; earth observation; Earth observation; Egypt; Electricity; Electricity distribution; Energy; Energy industry; Energy management; Energy resources; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Geographical variations; Greece; Industrial plant emissions; Irradiance; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mathematical models; MODIS; Monitoring; Observatories; Optical analysis; Optical thickness; Particulate matter; Particulates; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaics; Physics; Power plants; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Renewable resources; Satellite observation; Satellites; solar energy; Solar energy; Solar irradiance; Solar power; Solar radiation; Spectroradiometers; Sustainable development; United States--US; Weather forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability to understand these processes remained limited in terms of territorial scope and comparative capacity for a long time: data availability and harmonization were among the main constraints. Contemporary technological assets, such as remote sensing and machine learning, allow for analyzing global changes in the settlement process with unprecedented detail. The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project set out to produce detailed datasets to analyze and monitor the spatial footprint of human settlements and their population, which are key indicators for the global policy commitments of the 2030 Development Agenda. In the GHSL, Earth Observation plays a key role in the detection of built-up areas from the Landsat imagery upon which population distribution is modelled. The combination of remote sensing imagery and population modelling allows for generating globally consistent and detailed information about the spatial distribution of built-up areas and population. The GHSL data facilitate a multi-temporal analysis of human settlements with global coverage. The results presented in this article focus on the patterns of development of built-up areas, population and settlements. The article reports about the present status of global urbanization (2015) and its evolution since 1990 by applying to the GHSL the Degree of Urbanisation definition of the European Commission Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG-Regio) and the Statistical Office of the European Communities (EUROSTAT). The analysis portrays urbanization dynamics at a regional level and per country income classes to show disparities and inequalities. This study analyzes how the 6.1 billion urban dwellers are distributed worldwide. Results show the degree of global urbanization (which reached 85% in 2015), the more than 100 countries in which urbanization has increased between 1990 and 2015, and the tens of countries in which urbanization is today above the global average and where urbanization grows the fastest. The paper sheds light on the key role of urban areas for development, on the patterns of urban development across the regions of the world and on the role of a new generation of data to advance urbanization theory and reporting.","2018","2024-01-16 09:03:57","2024-01-19 11:00:31","","768","","5","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2056399390","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/YLNs5?_a=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%2BgIBToIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=Z3q%2F0peyllK%2Bp%2BQH7LzEicaaYvg%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Unveiling+25+Years+of+Planetary+Urbanization+with+Remote+Sensing%3A+Perspectives+from+the+Global+Human+Settlement+Layer&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2018-01-01&volume=10&issue=5&spage=768&au=Melchiorri%2C+Michele%3BFlorczyk%2C+Aneta+J%3BFreire%2C+Sergio%3BSchiavina%2C+Marcello%3BMartino+Pesaresi%3BKemper%2C+Thomas&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/Remote+Sens.+2018%2C+10%285%29%2C+768%3B+10.3390%2Frs10050768","Construction; Data processing; Detection; Human settlement; Human settlements; Image detection; Inequality; Land settlement; Landsat; Landsat satellites; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Physics; Population; Population (statistical); Population distribution; Population model; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Spatial distribution; Urban area; Urban areas; Urban development; Urban policy; Urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Poverty is one of the major challenges for our society in the upcoming decades, making it one of the most important issues in the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations. Satellite-based mapping can provide valuable information about slums where insights about the location and size are still missing. Large-scale slum mapping remains a challenge, fuzzy feature spaces between formal and informal settlements, significant imbalance of slum occurrences opposed to formal settlements, and various categories of multiple morphological slum features. We propose a transfer learned fully convolutional Xception network (XFCN), which is able to differentiate between formal built-up structures and the various categories of slums in high-resolution satellite data. The XFCN is trained on a large sample of globally distributed slums, located in cities of Cape Town, Caracas, Delhi, Lagos, Medellin, Mumbai, Nairobi, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Shenzhen. Slums in these cities are greatly heterogeneous inits morphological feature space and differ to a varying degree to formal settlements. Transfer learning can help to improve segmentation results when learning on a variety of slum morphologies, with high F1 scores of up to 89%.","2020","2024-01-16 09:24:07","2024-01-19 10:58:36","","5251-5263","","","13","","IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the last decade, statistical methods have gradually exerted their impact on mapping the landslide susceptibility to locate the high-risk places of landslide. However, due to the complexity of getting full access to the thematic information in large scenarios, most of these statistical methods generally suffer from overfitting, inadequate representative power, and the inability to transfer the learned representation to other places. To solve these challenges, this study designed an unsupervised representation learning module, which features independence, compactness, robustness, and transferability. Specifically, we first stack restricted Boltzmann machines and denoising autoencoder to unsupervised discover the underlying representations embedded in the thematic maps. Then, we applied the transferring strategy in an adversarial manner to generalize the learned representations to the sample-scarce area. Experimental results and analyses using data in different regions have revealed that the proposed method can be generalized well between different LSM scenarios. In terms of precision, it outperforms other methods by a large margin, e.g., by around 7% compared to multilayer perceptrons with the same configuration, and by 3%–4% to the state of art algorithm random forest. Besides, compared to other methods, the landslide susceptibility map that is predicted by the proposed method featuring smoothness and stableness seems more reliable, and is more according to some prior knowledge that, for example, distance to the drainage, slope, and stratum, should exert dominant effects on the occurrence of a landslide.","2020","2024-01-16 09:24:08","2024-01-19 11:00:24","","3917-3930","","","13","","IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies attempted to explain their correlation at the city or region level using built-up area metrics and nighttime light (NTL) data. However, more comprehensive studies on urban interior spatial characteristics and their relationship to NTL intensity are lacking in a three-dimension space. Using Luojia 1-01 nighttime light data, LiDAR digital surface model data, and other auxiliary data, this study applies an extreme gradient boosting regression model and Sharpley Additive exPlanations method to model and interpret the relationship between two-dimensional (2-D)/3-D landscape patterns and NTL intensity. Two study areas were selected to investigate the landscape–NTL relationship at the parcel and subdistrict levels. The major findings of this study include the following: 1) 2-D and 3-D urban landscape patterns have a close relationship with NTL intensity at the parcel and subdistrict scales; 2) the combinational metric of 2-D and 3-D landscape patterns has a stronger relationship with NTL intensity than either the 2-D or 3-D landscape metrics alone; 3) the correlations between most landscape metrics and NTL intensity are not simply positive or negative but change as metrics grow; and 4) the urban socioeconomic level is not only related to a single landscape metric sometimes but tends to the result of metrics interaction. These findings may help urban planners and government officials make more reasonable urban landscape planning policies under the goal of sustainable development.","2022","2024-01-16 09:24:08","2024-01-19 10:59:37","","478-489","","","15","","IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Zain","A Data-Intelligent Scheme Toward Smart Rescue and Micro-Services","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3257429","","A considerable portion of the world frequently experiences flooding during the monsoon season. As a result of this catastrophic event, hundreds of individuals have become homeless. In addition, rescuers are not usually effective enough to rescue the majority of victims. This is due to inadequate rescue operations infrastructure, a severe flaw in today’s technologically advanced society. This manuscript proposes a microservice-dependent secure rescue framework that uses geographic information system mapping with a K-Means clustering algorithm to identify flood-prone regions. Numerous microservices, such as fleet management, cloud computing, and data security, integrate and execute the framework in pre- and post-flood situations. Labeling data from the proposed framework generates a support vector machine-based classifier for predicting flood risk. Furthermore, a hybrid A* algorithm is developed to find an optimal route for the rescue operation. Based on the K-means clustering results, which reduced the variance by 89.2 percent overall, dividing the data into six clusters was the best option for this study. The smoothness of the suggested hybrid algorithm is also used to verify its superiority.","2023","2024-01-16 09:24:08","2024-01-19 10:25:54","","27086-27098","","","11","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper number, authors, institutions, corporations, publication sources, citations, and keywords are noted as sub/categories for the bibliometric analysis. Thematic LS data, including the study site, landslide inventory, conditioning factors, mapping unit, susceptibility models, and mode fit/prediction performance evaluation, are presented in the content analysis. Then, we reveal the advantages and limitations of the common approaches used in thematic LS data and summarise the development trends. The results indicate that the distribution of articles shows clear clusters of authors, institutions, and countries with high academic activity. The application of remote sensing technology for interpreting landslides provides a more convenient and efficient landslide inventory. In the landslide inventory, most of the sample strategies representing the landslides are point and polygon, and the most frequently used sample subdividing strategy is random sampling. The scale effects, lack of geographic consistency, and no standard are key problems in landslide conditioning factors. Feature selection is used to choose the factors that can improve the model's accuracy. With advances in computing technology and artificial intelligence, LS models are changing from simple qualitative and statistical models to complex machine learning and hybrid models. Finally, five future research opportunities are revealed. This study will help investigators clarify the status of LS research and provide guidance for future research.","2022-12","2024-01-18 14:54:01","2024-01-19 10:25:45","","86954-86993","","58","29","","Environ Sci Pollut Res Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36279056","","; ; ; ; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/dVOyP?_a=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&_s=8C6MiFRKXdJV6zvu%2Fgrd%2F2vPxOk%3D; https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/dVOyP?_a=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&_s=8C6MiFRKXdJV6zvu%2Fgrd%2F2vPxOk%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3A&atitle=A+bibliometric+and+content+analysis+of+research+trends+on+GIS-based+landslide+susceptibility+from+2001+to+2020&title=Environmental+Science+and+Pollution+Research&issn=09441344&date=2022-12-01&volume=29&issue=58&spage=86954&au=Huang%2C+Junpeng%3BWu%2C+Xiyong%3BLing%2C+Sixiang%3BLi%2C+Xiaoning%3BWu%2C+Yuxin%3BPeng%2C+Lei%3BHe%2C+Zhiyi&isbn=&jtitle=Environmental+Science+and+Pollution+Research&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11356-022-23732-z; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3A&atitle=A+bibliometric+and+content+analysis+of+research+trends+on+GIS-based+landslide+susceptibility+from+2001+to+2020&title=Environmental+Science+and+Pollution+Research&issn=09441344&date=2022-12-01&volume=29&issue=58&spage=86954&au=Huang%2C+Junpeng%3BWu%2C+Xiyong%3BLing%2C+Sixiang%3BLi%2C+Xiaoning%3BWu%2C+Yuxin%3BPeng%2C+Lei%3BHe%2C+Zhiyi&isbn=&jtitle=Environmental+Science+and+Pollution+Research&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11356-022-23732-z; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36279056","","Artificial Intelligence; Bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics; Content analysis; Geographic Information Systems; GIS; Landslide susceptibility; Landslides; Machine learning; Remote Sensing Technology; Research trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fire is a common form of disaster and has a wide range of impacts on climate, biogeochemical cycle and human health, highly related to the SDGs. Satellite remote sensing technology provides an effective way for the dynamic monitoring of global burned area (BA). However, the existing global BA products are mainly at low and medium spatial resolution, which is difficult for detecting small fires, and also has large errors in calculating area of burned land. Based on Landsat 8 surface reflectance data and Google Earth Engine platform, a novel multi-year (from the starting year of SDGs [2015] to the nearest year [2019]) 30 m resolution global BA products were generated. Based on these products, spatial distribution, influencing factors and change characteristics of BA were analyzed. The results show that from 2015 to 2019 the total area of BA in the world was 365.27, 368.56, 374.56, 345.55, and 363.09 ? 106 ha. From 2015 to 2019, the total area of global BA was relatively stable, however there were significant differences among various continents and regions. During the study period, BA in the Amazon and Australia changed dramatically. The huge Amazon fire in 2019 caused a reduction of 4.67 ? 106 ha of vegetated area in the Amazon basin, an increase in BA of 119.25% compared with 2018. In 2019, BA on the eastern and southeastern coasts of Australia increased abnormally. The possible reasons for these changes were comprehensively discussed and analyzed.","2021-06-01","2024-01-19 10:20:24","2024-01-19 10:20:24","2024-01-15","e2020EF001960","","6","9","","Earth's Future","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","climate anomalies; global burned area; global fire dynamics; human activity; Landsat; SDGs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, from the ERP and VES, the features such as shape, type, power, magnitude, pseudo-fracturing index, and ohmic-area were defined including the geology of the survey area. Second, the FRs were categorized into four classes (dry: FR0 (FR = 0), unsustainable: FR1 (0 < FR ≤ 1), and productive boreholes: FR2 (1 < FR ≤ 3) and FR3 (FR > 3 m3/hr)) and associated with the features to compose two separated data sets: a multiclass data set () for common prediction during the CDWS and a binary data set (FR < FR2, FR ≥ FR2) addressed to the population living in a rural area.

Results showed that the modeled annual ET significantly increased by ~2 mm yr?2 during this period (p < 0.001), caused by increased transpiration (2.16 mm yr?2) and interception (0.27 mm yr?2), which was partly offset by decreased soil evaporation (?0.47 mm yr?2).

Factorial simulations indicated that the intensifying ET over 79.4% and 9.1% of the study area can be explained by vegetation greening and climate change, respectively. Further analysis suggested that the vegetation greening and the increased ET were primarily associated with the rapid urbanization and agricultural intensification.

However, it faces challenges of hydrometeorological heterogeneities, parametric interactions, data uncertainty, computational expensiveness, and other complexities, especially over cold regions with intense climatic changes. As an effort to address them, a multifactorial principal-monotonicity inference (MFPMI) method is developed through integrating, extending, or improving climate classification, hydrologic modeling, and sensitivity analysis. MFPMI is applied to an undammed macro-scale high-latitude cold-region watershed, Athabasca River Basin (ARB) in Canada. MFPMI mitigates the underestimation of climatic impacts on streamflows in process-based models, hydrologic classification, large-scale hydroclimatic data deconstruction, parametric-interaction neglection, and climatic homogenization; its superiority is particularly evident for highly heterogeneous climates. Dominant climatic impacts on ARB streamflows of various regimes increase from tributaries to the mainstem and decrease from up- through down- to mid-stream catchments, possibly due to the offset effects of non-climatic factors (e.g., vegetation and soil). The impacts also decline with streamflow magnitudes, and vary with seasons, spatial scales and lead months rather than temporal resolutions. Streamflow magnitudes, catchments and metrics differ compositions of the climate conditions explaining cross-scale uppermost discharge variations. In spite of this, streamflow increases with temperature and precipitation, and headwater climates play part of dominant roles in forcing discharges throughout ARB. Accuracy metrics differentiate parameters and accordingly structures of MFPMI models, and hydroclimatic data uncertainty is high for high flows, fine temporal scales or low climatic impacts, increasing uncertainty in hydrologic simulations and climatic-impact estimates. This study helps advance modeling and understandings of macro-scale cold-region hydrology.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-15","e2021WR031370","","6","58","","Water Resources Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Athabasca river basin; climate change; cold region; data-driven modeling; hydrometeorological classification; parametric interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prominent methods of interaction analysis that focus on modeling or data-driven statistical correlation are often insufficient for giving an integrated view of interaction drivers and their complexity. These methods are also usually too technically complex and heavily data-driven to provide decision-makers with simple practical tools and easily actionable and understandable results. Here, we introduce a flexible and practical systemic approach, termed archetype analysis, that generalizes a number of recurring interaction patterns among the SDGs with unique drivers, behaviors, and policy implications. We review eight interaction archetypes as thinking aids to analyze some of the important synergies and trade-offs, supported by several empirical examples related to the SDGs (e.g., poverty, food, well-being, water, energy, housing, climate, and land use) to demonstrate how they can be operationalized in practice. The interaction archetypes are aimed to help researchers and policymakers as a diagnostic tool to identify fundamental mechanisms of barriers or policy resistance to SDG progress, a comparative tool to enhance knowledge transfer between different cases with similar drivers, and a prospective tool to design synergistic policies for sustainable development.","2022-09-01","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-15","e2022EF002873","","9","10","","Earth's Future","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenges that hinterland areas would face during the realization of SDGs has not yet received enough attentions. In this study, a context-based assessment of regional food balances was conducted, considering key challenges related to socio-economic development as well as land use competition under the framework of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and the implementation of reforestation. We examined one of the poorest hinterland provinces in China as a case study, projecting its food deficit and exploring the potential threats to and opportunities for SDG realization by 2030, including population growth, urbanization, urban land expansion and reforestation. The projections revealed a crop deficit of 4.9?9.8 million tonnes, corresponding to the food demands of 10.2?20.6 million people. Approximately 76%?81% of this deficit was expected to be caused by increased food demand, rather than reforestation policies. Therefore, for this less-developed area with low agricultural productivity and large groups of vulnerable people, population growth and urbanization are likely to result in demands for food that cannot be met locally. In addition, large-scale reforestation projects, while enhancing a number of key ecosystem services, will increase the local food deficit by promoting the abandonment of cropland. This will result in greater reliance on food imports, with potential impacts on SDG realization in other regions. These findings highlight the need for integrated governance across multiple scales to ensure hinterland sustainability.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-15","e2022EF002867","","12","10","","Earth's Future","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","food security; reforestation impacts; shared socioeconomic pathways; sustainable development; urbanization impacts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effect of population displacement under uncertain macroeconomic and climate change remains ambiguous. We adopt a sociohydrological model, with explicit consideration of the dynamics of human-water interactions, to explore the groundwater vulnerability of Beijing. We investigate how human response might shape the development trajectories of the groundwater-population-economy system under different macroscale economic and climate scenarios. Furthermore, we use a machine learning algorithm to identify the decisive factors to be considered for reducing groundwater vulnerability. Our results show that while rapid external economic development or larger annual average precipitation would enable recovery of the groundwater table in the short term, they may slacken human water shortage awareness and result in more acute groundwater depletion in the long run. Strengthening policymaker perceptions of groundwater depletion would prompt timely response policies for controlling population size. Improving the quantity and quality of labor force input to economic development would avoid downturns in the economy due to labor shortages. The outcomes of this study suggest that these strategies would effectively reduce groundwater vulnerability in the long run without causing severe socioeconomic recession.

Further analysis provided robust insights regarding how different hydrogeological parameters of the WBA, and their interplay, control aquifer productivity and sustainability. Results indicate that 97% of the simulated abstractions could sustain the yield of a hand pump (6 L/min), approximately 30% could also sustain yields >60 L/min, while only 1% could sustain yields greater than 300 L/min. The model indicates that an aquifer transmissivity value of approximately 1.4 m2/day is required for a successful hand-pumped borehole, while a higher yielding source (60 L/min) requires a transmissivity value of at least 9.5 m2/day. A global sensitivity analysis of 13 model input parameters shows that the thickness of the regolith and the maximum hydraulic conductivity developed at the base of the saprolite are the critical factors controlling success and sustainability for low yielding hand-pumped boreholes. For higher yielding supplies, the net recharge, the depth to groundwater, and the aquifer extent become increasingly significant. Results from this work have important implications for the potential for increased development of groundwater from WBAs in tropical Africa.","2020-09-01","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-15","e2020WR027746","","9","56","","Water Resources Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","Africa; groundwater productivity; numerical modeling; weathered crystalline basement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It explores the value added by existing hyperspectral data of similar characteristics to CHIME, namely AVIRIS-NG and PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), for detecting topsoil texture properties. The spatial variability is retrieved using the linear spectral mixture analysis, an image-based algorithm that breaks down the hyperspectral data set into fractional abundance of spectral classes within each pixel. The fractional abundance of image-based endmembers is broken into categories to find intervals having a spatial relation with texture components in terms of fine (clay and silt) or coarse (sand) abundance. The fraction maps obtained show similar spatial patterns to the USDA soil texture classification, obtained with a geostatistical approach. Specifically, AVIRIS CHIME-like FAM1 > 0.45 presented an agreement of 86% with clay and/or silt higher than 45% which, according to the United Stated Agriculture Department (USDA) intervals, correspond to loam-clay loam classes. Similar results are obtained with PRISMA with FAM2 0.20?0.35, overlapping 63% of the kriging-based USDA clay-loam class. The fractional abundance categories showing the highest overlap percentages are correlated with the short-wave infrared spectral range, showing average coefficients of 0.7 where wavelengths are over 1,500 nm. From 1700 nm, CHIME-like shows values of 0.8. In conclusion, this exploratory research and results leverage the opportunity of extending the processing chain to a larger number of case studies to better understand the physical relation between the spectral reflectance captured by new spaceborne hyperspectral sensors and the spatial patterns of soil texture classes.","2023-09-01","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-15","e2022JG007272","","9","128","","Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","CHIME/Sentinel 10; hyperspectral; linear spectral mixture analysis; topsoil texture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have attempted to evaluate deforestation and vegetation degradation fires (DDF) and predict how they will change in the future. In this study, we expanded a fire model used in the Community Land Model to reflect the diverse causes of DDF. This enabled us to differentiate DDFs by cause (climate change, wood harvesting, and cropland, pastureland, and urban land-use changes) and seasonality. We then predicted the state of fire regimes in the 2050s and 2090s under RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 scenarios. Our results indicate that the area affected by global total fires will decrease from the current 452 to 211?378 Mha yr?1 in the 2090s under RCP 6.0 and to 184?333 Mha yr?1 under RCP 2.6, mainly due to socioeconomic factors such as population and economic growth. We also predict that DDF will decrease from the current 73 million hectares per year (Mha yr?1) to 54?66 Mha yr?1 in the 2090s under RCP 6.0 and 46?55 Mha yr?1 under RCP 2.6. The main contributor to these decreases in DDF burned area was climate change, especially the increasing of precipitation. The impact of future land use change on future DDF was similar or slightly lower than present-day. South America, Indonesia, and Australia were identified as high-risk regions for future DDF, mainly due to the expansion of wood harvest and pastureland. Appropriate land and fire management policies will be needed to reduce future fire damage in these areas.","2021-05-01","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-19 10:20:25","2024-01-15","e2020EF001786","","5","9","","Earth's Future","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","","","climate change; climate change risk; fire risk; land use change; socioeconomic change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Free satellite images have been identified as a key resource that can be used to produce official statistics and analysis to measure progress towards SDGs, especially those that are concerned with the physical environment, such as forest, water, and crops. Satellite images can often be unusable due to missing data from cloud cover, particularly in tropical areas where the deforestation rates are high. There are existing methods for filling in image gaps; however, these are often computationally expensive in image classification or not effective at pixel scale. To address this, we use two machine learning methods—gradient boosted machine and random forest algorithms—to classify the observed and simulated 'missing' pixels in satellite images as either grassland or woodland. We also predict a continuous biophysical variable, Foliage Projective Cover (FPC), which was derived from satellite images, and perform accurate binary classification and prediction using only the latitude and longitude of the pixels. We compare the performance of these methods against each other and inverse distance weighted interpolation, which is a well-established spatial interpolation method. We find both of the machine learning methods, particularly random forest, perform fast and accurate classifications of both observed and missing pixels, with up to 0.90 accuracy for the binary classification of pixels as grassland or woodland. The results show that the random forest method is more accurate than inverse distance weighted interpolation and gradient boosted machine for prediction of FPC for observed and missing data. Based on the case study results from a sub-tropical site in Australia, we show that our approach provides an efficient alternative for interpolating images and performing land cover classifications.

This study proposed a framework to separate the contribution of natural and anthropogenic factors to ET of human-managed land cover types using the Random Forest Regressor (RFR). The steps include: (1) classify land cover into natural and human-managed land covers and then divide ET, meteorological, topographical, and geographical data into two parts corresponding to natural and human-managed land cover types; (2) construct a natural ET (ET n ) prediction model using natural land cover types of ET, and the corresponding meteorological, topographical and geographical factors; (3) the constructed ET n prediction model is used to predict the ET n of human-managed land cover types using the corresponding meteorological, topographical and geographical data as inputs, and (4) derive the anthropogenic ET (ET h ) by subtracting the natural ET from the total ET (ET t ) for human-managed land cover types. Take 2017 as an example, ET n and ET h for rainfed agriculture, mosaic agriculture, irrigated agriculture, and settlement in Colorado, Blue Nile, and Heihe Basin were separated by the proposed framework, with R 2 and NSE of predicted ET n above 0.95 and RB within 1% for all three basins. In the semi-arid Colorado River Basin and arid Heihe Basin, human activities on human-managed land cover types tended to increase ET higher than humid Blue Nile Basin. The anthropogenic contribution to total water consumption is approaching 53.68%, 66.47%, and 6.14% for the four human-managed land cover types in Colorado River Basin, Heihe Bain and Blue Nile Basin, respectively. The framework provides strong support for the disturbance of water resources by different anthropogenic activities at the basin scale and the accurate estimation of the impact of human activities on ET to help achieve water-related sustainable development goals.; Competing Interests: Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Geospatial data describing the energy system are required to manage generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with biodiversity, conservation and land protection priorities caused by the land-use and land-cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of solar generating capacity cannot fully address these needs 1-9 . Here we provide a global inventory of commercial-, industrial- and utility-scale PV installations (that is, PV generating stations in excess of 10 kilowatts nameplate capacity) by using a longitudinal corpus of remote sensing imagery, machine learning and a large cloud computation infrastructure. We locate and verify 68,661 facilities, an increase of 432 per cent (in number of facilities) on previously available asset-level data. With the help of a hand-labelled test set, we estimate global installed generating capacity to be 423 gigawatts (-75/+77 gigawatts) at the end of 2018. Enrichment of our dataset with estimates of facility installation date, historic land-cover classification and proximity to vulnerable areas allows us to show that most of the PV solar energy facilities are sited on cropland, followed by aridlands and grassland.

Currently, satellite remote sensing monitoring remains one of the most effective methods for the estimation of crop FVC. However, due to the significant difference in scale between the coarse resolution of satellite images and the scale of measurable data on the ground, there are significant uncertainties and errors in estimating crop FVC. Here, we adopt a Strategy of Upscaling-Downscaling operations for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and satellite data collected during 2 growing seasons of winter wheat, respectively, using backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) as support to fully bridge this scale gap using highly accurate the UAS-derived FVC (FVC UAS ) to obtain wheat accurate FVC. Through validation with an independent dataset, the BPNN model predicted FVC with an RMSE of 0.059, which is 11.9% to 25.3% lower than commonly used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and traditional Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-based method (NDVI-based) models. Moreover, all those models achieved improved estimation accuracy with the Strategy of Upscaling-Downscaling, as compared to only upscaling UAS data. Our results demonstrate that: (1) establishing a nonlinear relationship between FVC UAS and satellite data enables accurate estimation of FVC over larger regions, with the strong support of machine learning capabilities. (2) Employing the Strategy of Upscaling-Downscaling is an effective strategy that can improve the accuracy of FVC estimation, in the collaborative use of UAS and satellite data, especially in the boundary area of the wheat field. This has significant implications for accurate FVC estimation for winter wheat, providing a reference for the estimation of other surface parameters and the collaborative application of multisource data.; Competing Interests: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Temporal granularity is often limited in UHI studies based on satellite remote sensing data that typically has multi-day frequency coverage of a particular urban area. This low temporal frequency has restricted the development of models for predicting UHI. To resolve this limitation, this study has developed a cyber-based geographic information science and systems (cyberGIS) framework encompassing multiple machine learning models for predicting UHI with high-frequency urban sensor network data combined with remote sensing data focused on Chicago, Illinois, from 2018 to 2020. Enabled by rapid advances in urban sensor network technologies and high-performance computing, this framework is designed to predict UHI in Chicago with fine spatiotemporal granularity based on environmental data collected with the Array of Things (AoT) urban sensor network and Landsat-8 remote sensing imagery. Our computational experiments revealed that a random forest regression (RFR) model outperforms other models with the prediction accuracy of 0.45 degree Celsius in 2020 and 0.8 degree Celsius in 2018 and 2019 with mean absolute error as the evaluation metric. Humidity, distance to geographic center, and PM 2.5 concentration are identified as important factors contributing to the model performance. Furthermore, we estimate UHI in Chicago with 10-min temporal frequency and 1-km spatial resolution on the hottest day in 2018.

In Australia and other countries, large-scale wildfires have dramatically grown in frequency and size in recent years. These fires threaten the world's forests and urban woods, cause enormous environmental and property damage, and quite often result in fatalities. As a result of their increasing frequency, there is an ongoing debate over how to handle catastrophic wildfires and mitigate their social, economic, and environmental repercussions. Effective prevention, early warning, and response strategies must be well-planned and carefully coordinated to minimise harmful consequences to people and the environment. Rapid advancements in remote sensing technologies such as ground-based, aerial surveillance vehicle-based, and satellite-based systems have been used for efficient wildfire surveillance. This study focuses on the application of space-borne technology for very accurate fire detection under challenging conditions. Due to the significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in recent years, numerous studies have previously been conducted to examine how AI might be applied in various situations. As a result of its special physical and operational requirements, spaceflight has emerged as one of the most challenging application fields. This work contains a feasibility study as well as a model and scenario prototype for a satellite AI system. With the intention of swiftly generating alerts and enabling immediate actions, the detection of wildfires has been studied with reference to the Australian events that occurred in December 2019. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed, trained, and used from the ground up to detect wildfires while also adjusting their complexity to meet onboard implementation requirements for trusted autonomous satellite operations (TASO). The capability of a 1-dimensional convolution neural network (1-DCNN) to classify wildfires is demonstrated in this research and the results are assessed against those reported in the literature. In order to enable autonomous onboard data processing, various hardware accelerators were considered and evaluated for onboard implementation. The trained model was then implemented in the following: Intel Movidius NCS-2 and Nvidia Jetson Nano and Nvidia Jetson TX2. Using the selected onboard hardware, the developed model was then put into practice and analysis was carried out. The results were positive and in favour of using the technology that has been proposed for onboard data processing to enable TASO on future missions. The findings indicate that data processing onboard can be very beneficial in disaster management and climate change mitigation by facilitating the generation of timely alerts for users and by enabling rapid and appropriate responses.

Effectively mapping and monitoring the spatial distribution of soil salinity is essential. The main aim of this work was to map soil salinity in Shandong Province located on the Yellow River Delta of China using Sentinel-1/2 remote sensing data and digital elevation model (DEM) data, coupled with soil sampling data, and combined with four regression models: support vector regression (SVR), stepwise multi-regression (SMR), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest regression (RFR). For these purposes, 60 soil samples were collected during the field survey conducted from 9 to 14 October 2019, corresponding to the Sentinel-1/2 and DEM data. Then we established a soil salinity and feature dataset based on the sampled data and the features extracted from Sentinel-1/2 and DEM data. This study adopted the feature importance of the RF model to screen all features. The results showed that the CRSI index made the greatest contribution in retrieving soil salinity in this region. In this paper, 18 sampling points were used to validate and compare the performance of the four models. The results reveal that, compared with the other regression models, the PLSR model has the best performance (R2 = 0.66, and RMSE = 1.30). Finally, the PLSR method was used to predict the spatial distribution of soil salinity in the Yellow River Delta. We concluded that the model can be used effectively for the quantitative estimation of soil salinity and provides a useful tool for ecological construction.

A random forest classification model was trained on 70K ground-truth points from the LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) dataset. Within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing environment, the ELC10 map can be generated from approx. 700 TB of Sentinel imagery within approx. 4 days from a single research user account. The map achieved an overall accuracy of 90% across eight land cover classes and could account for statistical unit land cover proportions within 3.9% (R2 = 0.83) of the actual value. These accuracies are higher than that of CORINE (100 m) and other 10 m land cover maps including S2GLC and FROM-GLC10. Spectro-temporal metrics that capture the phenology of land cover classes were most important in producing high mapping accuracies. We found that the atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 and the speckle filtering of Sentinel-1 imagery had a minimal effect on enhancing the classification accuracy (<1%). However, combining optical and radar imagery increased accuracy by 3% compared to Sentinel-2 alone and by 10% compared to Sentinel-1 alone. The addition of auxiliary data (terrain, climate and night-time lights) increased accuracy by an additional 2%. By using the centroid pixels from the LUCAS Copernicus module polygons we increased accuracy by <1%, revealing that random forests are robust against contaminated training data. Furthermore, the model requires very little training data to achieve moderate accuracies—the difference between 5K and 50K LUCAS points is only 3% (86% vs. 89%). This implies that significantly less resources are necessary for making in situ survey data (such as LUCAS) suitable for satellite-based land cover classification. At 10 m resolution, the ELC10 map can distinguish detailed landscape features like hedgerows and gardens, and therefore holds potential for aerial statistics at the city borough level and monitoring property-level environmental interventions (e.g., tree planting). Due to the reliance on purely satellite-based input data, the ELC10 map can be continuously updated independent of any country-specific geographic datasets.

Due to the lack of relevant studies and low precision of spaceborne spectroscopy, estimating soil heavy metal concentrations is challenging. In this study, we developed a coupled retrieval to qualify the heavy metal nickel (Ni) concentration in agricultural soil from spaceborne hyperspectral imagery. The retrieval couples spectral feature extraction from multi-scale discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and dimension reduction (DR), optimal band combination algorithm to five machine learning retrieval models using tree-based ensemble learning, neural network-based, and kernel-based. The comparison between the retrievals and Ni measurements shows that the DWT combined with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) coupled extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) retrieval model exhibited the best prediction for the validation dataset. Moreover, due to the integration of six statistical indicators of model performance and the fitted slope of the regression line, the retrieval framework can produce more robust and accurate predictions than those that rely on correlation coefficients. The demonstrated potential of spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing to provide accurate quantitative measurements of soil heavy metal concentrations will serve as a reference for agricultural plot applications worldwide.; Competing Interests: Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This paper introduces a methodology for the classification of annual high-resolution satellite data into several detailed land cover classes. In particular, a nomenclature with 27 different classes was introduced based on CORINE Land Cover (CLC) Level-3 categories and further analysing various crop types. Without employing cloud masks and/or interpolation procedures, we formed experimental datasets of Landsat-8 (L8) images with gradually increased cloud cover in order to assess the influence of cloud presence on the reference data and the resulting classification accuracy. The performance of shallow kernel-based and deep patch-based machine learning classification frameworks was evaluated. Quantitatively, the resulting overall accuracy rates differed within a range of less than 3%; however, maps produced based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) were more accurate across class boundaries and the respective framework was less computationally expensive compared to the applied patch-based deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Further experimental results and analysis indicated that employing all multitemporal images with up to 30% cloud cover delivered relatively higher overall accuracy rates as well as the highest per-class accuracy rates. Moreover, by selecting 70% of the top-ranked features after applying a feature selection strategy, slightly higher accuracy rates were achieved. A detailed discussion of the quantitative and qualitative evaluation outcomes further elaborates on the performance of all considered classes and highlights different aspects of their spectral behaviour and separability.

However, the monitoring, prediction and control of grasshoppers are complex and difficult. Therefore, it is crucial to detect the key factors affecting the spatial distribution of grasshopper occurrence, understand the role of the environmental factors in grasshopper occurrence, and study whether different laws exist between different grass types. Here we conduct a species–environmental matching model integrated by Maxent model and remote sensing data to identify the spatial distribution of grasshopper occurrence in Inner Mongolia of China, analyze the related environmental variables and detect the most relevant environmental factors for grasshopper occurrence both in typical steppe and meadow steppe. Grasshoppers mainly threaten natural grassland vegetation and crops. Therefore, it is of great significance to understand the relationship between environmental factors and grasshopper occurrence. This paper studies the spatial distribution and key factors of grasshopper occurrence in two grass types by integrating a machine learning model (Maxent) and remote sensing data within the major grasshopper occurrence areas of Inner Mongolia, China. The modelling results demonstrate that the typical steppe has larger suitable area and more proportion for grasshopper living than meadow steppe. The soil type, above biomass, altitude and temperature mainly determine the grasshopper occurrence in typical steppe and meadow steppe. However, the contribution of these factors in the two grass types is significantly different. In addition, related vegetation and meteorological factors affect the different growing stages of grasshoppers between the two grass types. This study clearly defines the different effects of key environmental factors (meteorology, vegetation, soil and topography) for grasshopper occurrence in typical steppe and meadow steppe. It also provides a methodology to guide early warning and precautions for grasshopper pest prevention. The findings of this study will be helpful for future management measures, to ensure grass ecological environment security and the sustainable development of grassland.

In Europe EUNIS (European Nature Information System) is a system tool for habitat identification and assessment. Earth Observation (EO) data, which are acquired by satellite sensors, offer new opportunities for environmental sciences and they are revolutionizing the methodologies applied. These are providing unprecedented insights for habitat monitoring and for evaluating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators. This paper shows the results of a novel approach for a spatially explicit habitat mapping in Italy at a national scale, using a supervised machine learning model (SMLM), through the combination of vegetation plot database (as response variable), and both spectral and environmental predictors. The procedure integrates forest habitat data in Italy from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA), with Sentinel-2 imagery processing (vegetation indices time series, spectral indices, and single bands spectral signals) and environmental data variables (i.e., climatic and topographic), to parameterize a Random Forests (RF) classifier. The obtained results classify 24 forest habitats according to the EUNIS III level: 12 broadleaved deciduous (T1), 4 broadleaved evergreen (T2) and eight needleleaved forest habitats (T3), and achieved an overall accuracy of 87% at the EUNIS II level classes (T1, T2, T3), and an overall accuracy of 76.14% at the EUNIS III level. The highest overall accuracy value was obtained for the broadleaved evergreen forest equal to 91%, followed by 76% and 68% for needleleaved and broadleaved deciduous habitat forests, respectively. The results of the proposed methodology open the way to increase the EUNIS habitat categories to be mapped together with their geographical extent, and to test different semi-supervised machine learning algorithms and ensemble modelling methods.

As one of the most concentrated regions for freshwater lakes, the Yangtze-Huaihe region plays a significant role in monitoring TP concentrations for the sustainable utilisation of China's water resources. In this study, a TP concentration estimation model suitable for large-sized lake groups was developed using a combination of measured and remote sensing data powered by advanced machine learning algorithms. Compared to traditional empirical models, the model developed in this study demonstrates significant accuracy in fitting (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.08 mg/L, MAPE = 34.20%). Moreover, the application of this model to lakes in the Yangtze-Huaihe region from 2017 to 2022 has been conducted. The multi-year average TP concentration was 0.18 mg/L. Spatial distribution analyses showed that total phosphorus concentrations were higher in small lakes. In terms of temporal changes, the interannual decreases in total phosphorus concentrations were 0.02 mg/L, 0.01 mg/L, and 0.01 mg/L for small, medium, and large lakes, respectively. We also found that large lakes typically exhibited a ""high in spring and summer, low in autumn and winter"" pattern until 2020, but transitioned to a ""high in summer and autumn, low in spring and winter"" pattern after 2020 due to the removal of closed fish nets, which were having a significant impact on the lake ecosystem. Other lakes in the area consistently showed a pattern of ""high in spring and summer, low in autumn and winter"" during the six-year period. These findings may provide useful references and suggestions for the environmental protection and management of lakes in China.

However, the DMSP-OLS NTL data and the associated processing methods have limited their reliability and applicability for systematic measuring and mapping of socioeconomic development. This study utilized Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) NTL and the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm for more intelligent data processing to capture human activities. We used machine learning and NTL data to map gross domestic product (GDP) at 1 km2. We then used these data products to derive inequality indexes (e.g., Gini coefficients) at nationally aggregate levels. This flexible approach processes the data in an unsupervised manner at various spatial scales. Our assessments show that this method produces accurate subnational GDP data products for mapping and monitoring human development uniformly across the globe.

The PROSAIL model, which couples the properties optique spectrales des feuilles (PROSPECT) and scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves (SAIL) radiative transfer models, is commonly used for the quantitative retrieval of crop parameters; however, its homogeneous canopy assumption limits its accuracy, especially in the case of multiple crop categories. The adjusted average leaf angle (ALAadj), which can be parameterized for a specific crop type, increases the applicability of the PROSAIL model for specific crop types with a non-uniform canopy and has the potential to enhance the performance of PROSAIL-coupled hybrid methods. In this study, the PROSAIL-D model was used to generate the ALAadj values of wheat, soybean, and maize crops based on ground-measured spectra, the LAI, and the leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). The results revealed ALAadj values of 62 degrees for wheat, 45 degrees for soybean, and 60 degrees for maize. Support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), extremely randomized trees regression (ETR), the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), and stacking learning (STL) were applied to simulated data of the ALAadj in 50-band data to retrieve the CCC and LAI of the crops. The results demonstrated that the estimation accuracy of singular crop parameters, particularly the crop LAI, was greatly enhanced by the five machine learning methods on the basis of data simulated with the ALAadj. Regarding the estimation results of mixed crops, the machine learning algorithms using ALAadj datasets resulted in estimations of CCC (RMSE: RFR = 51.1 μg cm−2, ETR = 54.7 μg cm−2, GBRT = 54.9 μg cm−2, STL = 48.3 μg cm−2) and LAI (RMSE: SVR = 0.91, RFR = 1.03, ETR = 1.05, GBRT = 1.05, STL = 0.97), that outperformed the estimations without using the ALAadj (namely CCC RMSE: RFR = 93.0 μg cm−2, ETR = 60.1 μg cm−2, GBRT = 60.0 μg cm−2, STL = 68.5 μg cm−2 and LAI RMSE: SVR = 2.10, RFR = 2.28, ETR = 1.67, GBRT = 1.66, STL = 1.51). Similar findings were obtained using the suggested method in conjunction with 19-band data, demonstrating the promising potential of this method to estimate the CCC and LAI of crops at the satellite scale.

Smallholder farmers play a crucial role in combating food insecurity. However, local planning agencies and governments do not have adequate spatial information on smallholder farmers, and this affects the monitoring of the SDGs. This study utilized Sentinel-1 multi-temporal data to develop a framework for mapping smallholder maize farms and to estimate maize production area as a parameter for supporting the SDGs. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to pixel fuse the multi-temporal data to only three components for each polarization (vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV), vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH), and VV/VH), which explained more than 70% of the information. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost) algorithms were used at model-level feature fusion to classify the data. The results show that the adopted strategy of two-stage image fusion was sufficient to map the distribution and estimate production areas for smallholder farms. An overall accuracy of more than 90% for both SVM and Xgboost algorithms was achieved. There was a 3% difference in production area estimation observed between the two algorithms. This framework can be used to generate spatial agricultural information in areas where agricultural survey data are limited and for areas that are affected by cloud coverage. We recommend the use of Sentinel-1 multi-temporal data in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to map smallholder maize farms to support the SDGs.

This contradiction is primarily due to the widespread constructions of reservoirs and intensive anthropogenic activities in coastal regions. In addition, coasts are particularly vulnerable to hazards due to climate change, such as sea-level rise, as they are located at the transition zone of terrestrial and marine environments. Along with the fact that Taiwan is an island and is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, coastal management and sustainability are nationally critical topics, especially considering the ongoing reformation and legislation of Taiwan's coastal conservation laws. As stated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) goal 14, accurate and continuous shoreline positions information is essential for coastal conservation. However, by reviewing previous global studies and projects commissioned by the Taiwanese government aiming at monitoring shoreline changes, they usually exhibit several limitations, such as limited band selections or conservative band ratio-derived water indices, relying on either manual digitization or simple thresholding methods, focusing on either artificial or smoothly shaped coasts, and using images acquired at considerably different tidal height levels. Therefore, in the present study, a subpixel shoreline extraction approach based on a sustainable cross-generation dataset and a robust edge detection algorithm is proposed. This approach is exemplified by the Zengwun River Estuary located in southwestern Taiwan-Taiwan's most critical coastal preservation region. By quantitatively analyzing the resultant time-series shoreline positions from 1999 to 2021, several hotspots of shoreline recession have been identified: an extreme erosional rate up to -69.4 m year -1 is revealed in the northern sand bank; while the offshore sand bar demonstrates an overall landward retreat rate of -35.4 ± 1.24 m year -1 .; Competing Interests: Declaration of competing interest The author declares that there is no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Traditionally, it often takes much time and labor costs to copy and pre-process remote sensing images for performing land cover classification with desktop software, which must be installed and licensed. Google Earth Engine (GEE), as a cloud computing platform, provides a large number of remote sensing images, geoprocessing algorithms and massive computational capabilities via web interfaces. However, GEE requires users to possess programming skills of JavaScript or Python language, which can hinder the enthusiasm of many academics without programming skills. This paper developed a web-based and open-access toolkit O-LCMapping for supporting online land cover classification. This toolkit was implemented with JavaScript application programming interfaces of GEE and integrated ten imagery classification algorithms. The toolkit explicitly provides the entire pipeline of land cover classification in the form of user interfaces for end-users with basic knowledge of remote sensing but little programming skills. Concretely, it enables end-users to define study area, select remote sensing data, mark classification samples, set classification algorithms, evaluate accuracy and output results through user interfaces. Three different experimental cases indicate that the toolkit can be easily applied to different fields for various applications of land cover classification.

Despite being a widely used cartographic product, the precision map contemporarily exists outside of a theoretical cartographic framework. Geographical Information Science and Remote Sensing on the other hand have already found entry in agricultural practices (Usery, Pocknee, & Boydell, 1995; Papp et al., 2021), laying the foundation for precision agriculture (Sishodia et al., 2020). Making use of sensing systems to obtain (near real-time) environmental data, precision agriculture relies on the extraction of relevant, high-resolution geoinformation to be communicated visually to the end-user (Sishodia et al., 2020). Cartography as an interdisciplinary domain bears a huge potential in meeting the increasing demand for the decision-supporting visualisation of Big Data (Coetzee et al., 2020; Robinson et al., 2017), and thus may contribute to the development of more sustainable agriculture. The focus of this research is on plant disease detection, as plant pests endanger tree health and harvest, thus highlighting farmers' vulnerability to plant diseases and ultimately undermining Sustainable Development Goals, such as Zero Hunger and food security (Savary et al., 2012). In contrast to traditional plant disease management, plant health monitoring through hyperspectral data would enable stakeholders to detect plant stress outside the range of visible light, and hence, at an early disease stage. Particularly, near- and short-wave infrared bands provide crucial information on plant health, allowing early intervention in plant disease control (Lowe, Harrison, & French, 2017). Apple Proliferation (AP), a phytoplasma disease transmitted through insects, will be used as a case study in the Upper Adige Valley in South Tyrol (Italy) to propose a technology- and data-driven strategy for an early, non-destructive plant disease detection and monitoring based on hyperspectral data. The work in progress consists of the following research objectives: - developing a cartographic understanding and definition for a precision map, - identifying relevant spectral bands (SB's) and vegetation indices (VI's) that allow meaningful discrimination between leaves infected with AP and uninfected leaves (binary discrimination), - implementing a robust and reproducible image classification procedure based on a machine learning approach specifically for the identification of AP on varying levels of detail (at the leaf, tree, and orchard level), - establishing a mapping technique to produce precision maps dedicated to AP on different levels of detail Following a multi-modal and multi-scale data acquisition approach, several remote sensing techniques were applied: adopting a ground sensing approach, individual leaf spectral signatures were obtained through a spectroradiometer equipped with a leaf clipping tool extension; airborne proximal sensing was conducted on the orchard level using UAVmounted multi- and hyperspectral cameras. Insights gained through the spectral data analysis served as the basis for the subsequent multi- and hyperspectral waveband selection and composition of adequate vegetation indices. Additionally, machine learning techniques were adopted for image classification to delineate infected from uninfected trees. A hexagonal grid structure assimilating the tree rows is used for cartographic generalisation of the image classifications as well as for abstraction of the tree canopy shape by the individual hexagonal cell. Finally, the high-resolution classification on the leaf level and the aggregated spatial information regarding the AP infection on the tree and orchard level (i.e. as gridded abstraction) are presented as interrelated map-layers. Following Shneiderman's (1996) visualisation mantra Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand, the map user will first be presented with a general overview of aggregated spatial data on the orchard level, from which he/she can move between layers through zooming to obtain further detail at the tree and intra-tree level. This multi-scale view in precision mapping is also temporal in nature, as multiple UAV flights were undertaken in several phenological stages, providing further insight into the spatio-temporal disease evolution of Apple Proliferation. The findings will be available on the Eurac Research Environmental Data Platform (https://www.maps.eurac.edu), a geoportal based on an open spatial data infrastructure (SDI) and managed by the Center for Sensing Solutions. Internally referred to as Maps, the geoportal is based on software maintained by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo), such that the interactive map user interface is based on the framework of geoNode and OpenLayers. The spatial data is managed through PostGIS (a PostgreSQL extension), which is then hosted through GeoServer that in turn is coupled with pycsw as well as GeoNetwork as respective metadata catalogues. Following Coetzee et al.'s idea (2020), this research is anticipated to be open science, thus findings and geodata from this research should be accessible to the public through FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) (Wilkinson et al. 2016), free and open-source geospatial software and infrastructure as well as map services. This experimental case study is expected to encourage future development and implementation of cartography in agriculture and foster the cartographic understanding and application of precision mapping using multi- and hyperspectral data.

Rotatable bounding box annotations were employed to improve positioning accuracy, and an algorithm for automatic annotation was proposed to improve efficiency. The dataset exhibits three crucial properties: richness, stability, and challenge. It comprises 1044 chips and 12,013 vehicle instances, most of which are situated in complex backgrounds. To construct a baseline, eight detection algorithms are evaluated on SIVED. The experimental results show that all detectors achieved high mean average precision (mAP) on the test set, highlighting the dataset's stability. However, there is still room for improvement in the accuracy with respect to the complexity of the background.

Here, we developed an automated hybrid machine learning algorithm by selecting the optimal model from 24 models to map potential forest fire vulnerability over China during the period 2001–2020. The results showed forest aboveground biomass (AGB) had a vulnerability of 26%, indicating that approximately 2.32 Gt C/year of forest AGB could be affected by fire disturbances. The spatiotemporal patterns of forest fire vulnerability were dominated by both forest characteristics and climate conditions. Hotspot regions for vulnerability were mainly located in arid areas in western China, mountainous areas in southwestern China, and edges of vegetation zones. The overall forest fire vulnerability across China was insignificant. The forest fire vulnerability of boreal and temperate coniferous forests and mixed forests showed obviously decreasing trends, and cultivated forests showed an increasing trend. The results of this study are expected to provide important support for the forest ecosystem management in China.

However, they are constantly faced with danger posed by the harsh environment. For decision-making, it is a prerequisite to have the macro-scale suitability information about human activity site selection. Here, we define a new index, the human activity suitability (HAS) index, to quantitatively analyze the locational suitability of human activity sites over Antarctic ice shelves. Two multi-criteria decision analysis methods (AHP + Entropy, TOPSIS) and three machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest and logistic regression) are tested to develop HAS maps. Nine conditioning factors about ice surface features, ice shelf stability, meteorology and topography are generated as input parameters. The accuracy of the proposed models is evaluated using metrics such as the area under curve (AUC-ROC), root mean square error, overall accuracy and kappa index. The results indicate that the Random Forest performs best. The HAS map exhibits great heterogeneity driven by the synergistic influence of multiple factors. Areas in low HAS classes are concentrated at Crosson, Brunt, Thwaites and the edge of some ice shelves, implying the complex environment in these regions. The findings can provide a new insight for forecasting the potential human footprint and support sustainability research in Antarctica.

As a means to develop or update household listings in LMICs, this paper explores the use of machine learning models to detect and enumerate building structures directly from satellite imagery in the Kaduna state of Nigeria. Specifically, an object detection model was used to identify and locate buildings in satellite images. In the test set, the model attained a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.48 for detecting structures, with relatively higher values in areas with lower building density (mAP = 0.65). Furthermore, when model predictions were compared against recent household listings from fieldwork in Nigeria, the predictions showed high correlation with household coverage (Pearson = 0.70; Spearman = 0.81). With the need to produce comparable, scalable SDG indicators, this case study explores the feasibility and challenges of using object detection models to help develop timely enumerated household lists in LMICs.

A crucial resource for targeting further investment of public and private resources, as well as tracking the progress of universal electrification goals, is shared access to high-quality data on individual SHS installations including information such as location and power capacity. Though recent studies utilizing satellite imagery and machine learning to detect solar panels have emerged, they struggle to accurately locate many SHS due to limited image resolution (some small solar panels only occupy several pixels in satellite imagery). In this work, we explore the viability and cost-performance tradeoff of using automatic SHS detection on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery as an alternative to satellite imagery. More specifically, we explore three questions: (i) what is the detection performance of SHS using drone imagery; (ii) how expensive is the drone data collection, compared to satellite imagery; and (iii) how well does drone-based SHS detection perform in real-world scenarios? To examine these questions, we collect and publicly-release a dataset of high-resolution drone imagery encompassing SHS imaged under a variety of real-world conditions and use this dataset and a dataset of imagery from Rwanda to evaluate the capabilities of deep learning models to recognize SHS, including those that are too small to be reliably recognized in satellite imagery. The results suggest that UAV imagery may be a viable alternative to identify very small SHS from perspectives of both detection accuracy and financial costs of data collection. UAV-based data collection may be a practical option for supporting electricity access planning strategies for achieving sustainable development goals and for monitoring the progress towards those goals.

At the same time, rapid advancements have also been taking place in tracing, mapping, remote sensing, machine learning, and modelling technologies in hydrological research. Despite those programs and advancements, a water crisis is intensifying globally. The missing link is effective interactions between the hydrological research and water resource management to support implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at multiple spatial scales. Since the watershed is the natural unit for water resources management, watershed science offers the potential to bridge this missing link. This study first reviews the advances in hydrological research and water resources management, and then discusses issues and challenges facing the global water community. Subsequently, it describes the core components of watershed science: (1) hydrological analysis; (2) water-operation policies; (3) governance; (4) management and feedback. The framework takes into account water availability, water uses, and water quality; explicitly focuses on the storage, fluxes, and quality of the hydrological cycle; defines appropriate local water resource thresholds through incorporating the planetary boundary framework; and identifies specific actionable measures for water resources management. It provides a complementary approach to the existing water management programs in addressing the current global water crisis and achieving the UN SDGs.

Here, we applied the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services to assess and compare the contents of 631 abstracts on the interactions among biodiversity, ecosystem services, human wellbeing, and drivers of change, and formulate a set of research recommendations. Our comparative assessment of literature pertained to the Andes, the East African mountains, the European Alps, and the Hindu Kush Himalaya. It revealed interesting differences between mountain systems, in particular in the relative importance given in the literature to individual drivers of change and to the ecosystem services delivered along elevational gradients. Based on our analysis and with reference to alternative conceptual frameworks of mountain social–ecological systems, we propose future research directions and options. In particular, we recommend improving biodiversity information, generating spatially explicit knowledge on ecosystem services, integrating knowledge and action along elevational gradients, generating knowledge on interacting effects of global change drivers, delivering knowledge that is relevant for transformative action toward sustainable mountain development, and using comprehensive concepts and codesigned approaches to effectively address knowledge gaps.]","2020","2024-01-19 10:21:46","2024-01-19 10:21:52","2024-01-15","R1-R14","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: International Mountain Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With impending climate-related risks such as increased coastal erosion and rising sea levels, coupled with rapid urban development, gaps in our knowledge of the human history of this continent are in jeopardy of becoming permanent. Spaceborne and aerial remote sensing instruments are powerful tools for producing relatively complete records of archaeological settlement patterns and human behavior at landscape scales. These sensors allow for massive amounts of information to be recorded and analyzed in short spans of time and offer an effective means to increase survey areas and the discovery of new cultural deposits. In this paper, we review various case studies throughout Africa dealing with aerial and satellite remote sensing applications to landscape archaeology in order to highlight recent developments and future research avenues. Specifically, we argue that (semi)automated remote sensing methods stemming from machine learning developments will prove vital to expanding our knowledge base of Africa's archaeological record. This is especially important for coastal and island regions of the continent where climate change threatens the survival of much of the archaeological record. L'Afrique représente une vaste région où les technologies de télédétection ont été largement inégales dans leurs applications archéologiques. Avec les risques imminents liés au changement climatique, tels que la progression de l'érosion côtière et de la montée du niveau de la mer, ainsi que le développement urbain rapide, les lacunes dans nos connaissances sur l'histoire humaine de ce continent risquent de devenir permanentes. Les instruments de télédétection spatiaux et aériens sont des outils puissants pour produire des relevés relativement complets des peuplements archéologiques et du comportement humain à l'échelle du paysage. Ces capteurs permettent d'enregistrer et d'analyser d'énormes quantités d'informations en peu de temps et offrent un moyen efficace d'élargir les zones de prospection et de découvrir de nouveaux dépôts culturels. Dans cet article, nous passons en revue diverses études de cas à travers l'Afrique portant sur les applications de la télédétection aérienne et satellitaire à l'archéologie paysagère afin de souligner les développements récents et les pistes de recherche futures. En particulier, nous soutenons que les méthodes de télédétection (semi)automatisées issues du développement de l'apprentissage automatique s'avéreront vitales pour élargir notre base de connaissances des archives archéologiques de l'Afrique.

Some of the supposedly rural settlements in the region have experienced increasing change in their landscapes over the last 3 decades, resulting in significant land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Among such settlements, Phuthaditjhaba and its environs are slowly becoming a metropolitan area. Based on conceptual considerations regarding sustainable urban development, we assessed LULC change using 4 Landsat images from 1989, 1999, 2009, and 2019 and a combination of unsupervised and supervised classification methods. The images were classified into 4 LULC classes. Between 1989 and 2019, the urban built-up area in Phuthaditjhaba increased from about 5% to 19%, representing a total increase of 270%. However, the greatest increase in land cover was in bare surface at the expense of vegetated areas, including farmland, which decreased from about 45% to 15%. The increase in bare surface could be due to fires. Built-up areas also increased due to a consistent increase in population density in the study area. We further described spatial patterns in LULC using selected landscape metrics. A decrease in patch density (PD) and cohesion, coupled with constant edge density (ED) and an increase in the fractal dimensional index (FDI), indicates fragmentation and less connectivity between 1989 and 1999; we interpret this as a sign of unsustainability. An increase in PD and cohesion and fluctuations in ED and FDI show that land patterns were more aggregated between 2009 and 2019. At the class level, an increase in PD, cohesion, and ED also showed more aggregated land patterns, which was confirmed by the mean patch size. The FDI revealed greater connectivity, which we also interpreted as unsustainable because of the increase in bare surface and built-up areas.

We present a new modeling toolkit, “Mapping Ecosystem Services to Human well-being” (MESH), that integrates commonly used, stand-alone ecosystem services (ES) models from the InVEST suite of models to quantify and illustrate the trade-offs and synergies across five ecosystem services and up to 10 associated SDGs. Development of the software and its functionality were informed by a broad stakeholder consultation with ministries, non-governmental organizations and civil society groups in West Africa to identify common barriers to uptake and application of modeling tools in developing countries. In light of this process, key features included in MESH are (1) integration of multiple ecosystem service (ES) models into a common modeling framework supported by a curated base data set, (2) built-in scenario generation capacity to support policy analysis, (3) visualization of outcomes and trade-offs, and (4) mapping of ecosystem service change to SDG targets and goals. We illustrate the use of MESH in a case study in the Volta basin of West Africa comparing the effectiveness of three alternative conservation prioritization approaches: (1) land cover-based, (2) topographic-based, and (3) an ecosystem service-based approach to minimize the impact of agricultural expansion.

A range of indices has been proposed to interpret this information. For instance, the “Human Development Index” was designed to specifically capture development in terms of life expectancy, education, and standard of living. However, the general question which independent dimensions are essential to capture all aspects of development still remains open. Using a nonlinear dimensionality reduction approach we aim to extract the core dimensions of development in a highly efficient way. We find that more than 90% of variance in the WDIs can be represented by solely five uncorrelated dimensions. The first dimension, explaining 74% of variance, represents the state of education, health, income, infrastructure, trade, population, and pollution. Although this dimension resembles the HDI, it explains much more variance. The second dimension (explaining 10% of variance) differentiates countries by gender ratios, labor market, and energy production patterns. Here, we differentiate societal structures when comparing e.g. countries from the Middle-East to the Post-Soviet area. Our analysis confirms that most countries show rather consistent temporal trends towards wealthier and aging societies. We can also find deviations from the long-term trajectories during warfare, environmental disasters, or fundamental political changes. The data-driven nature of the extracted dimensions complements classical indicator approaches, allowing a broader exploration of global development space. The extracted independent dimensions represent different aspects of development that need to be considered when proposing new metric indices.]","2020","2024-01-19 10:21:46","2024-01-19 10:21:51","2024-01-15","999-1020","","3","150","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: Springer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional methods of habitat assessment rely strongly on field-based surveys, which are logistically demanding and relatively costly. We describe and investigate a process that relies on information technology to develop a scalable method that can be applied across multiple farms to reduce the significant logistical challenges and financial costs of traditional habitat surveys. A key impediment to the routine development of farm habitat maps is the lack of information on the type of habitats that occur on a land parcel. Within a pilot project comprising 187 farms, we developed and implemented a process for creating farm habitat reports and investigate the accuracy of visual interpretation of satellite imagery by an ecologist aiming to identify habitat types. We generated customised farm reports that included a colour-coded farm habitat map and habitat information (type, area, relative wildlife importance). Visual assessment of satellite imagery achieved an overall accuracy of 96% in its ability to discriminate between land parcels with habitats categorised by this study as being of either high or low nature conservation value. Assessment of satellite imagery achieved an overall accuracy of 90% in its ability to discriminate among Fossitt level II habitat classes, and an overall accuracy of 81% when using individual habitat classes (Fossitt level III). There was, however, considerable variation in the accuracy associated with individual habitat classes. We conclude that this methodology based on satellite imagery is sufficiently accurate to be used for the incorporation of farmland habitats into farm-scale sustainability assurance, but should, at most, use Fossitt level II habitat classes. We discuss future challenges and opportunities for the development of farm habitat maps and plans for their use in sustainability certification schemes.]","2020","2024-01-19 10:21:46","2024-01-19 10:21:51","2024-01-15","56-69","","1","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","Publisher: TEAGASC-Agriculture and Food Development Authority","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine the role that satellite data could have in monitoring progress toward reducing poverty in rural areas by asking two questions: (i) Can household wealth be predicted from satellite data? (ii) Can a socioecologically informed multilevel treatment of the satellite data increase the ability to explain variance in household wealth? We found that satellite data explained up to 62% of the variation in household level wealth in a rural area of western Kenya when using a multilevel approach. This was a 10% increase compared with previously used single-level methods, which do not consider details of spatial landscape use. The size of buildings within a family compound (homestead), amount of bare agricultural land surrounding a homestead, amount of bare ground inside the homestead, and the length of growing season were important predictor variables.

While datasets predominately include images for post-disaster remote sensing analyses, images alone cannot provide detailed geometric information due to a lack of depth or the complexity required to extract geometric details. However, geometric and color information can easily be mined from three-dimensional (3D) point clouds. Scene classification is commonly studied within the field of machine learning, where a workflow follows a pipeline operation to compute a series of engineered features for each point and then points are classified based on these features using a learning algorithm. However, these workflows cannot be directly applied to an aerial 3D point cloud due to a large number of points, density variation, and object appearance. In this study, the point cloud datasets are transferred into a volumetric grid model to be used in the training and testing of 3D fully convolutional network models. The goal of these models is to semantically segment two areas that sustained damage after Hurricane Harvey, which occurred in 2017, into six classes, including damaged structures, undamaged structures, debris, roadways, terrain, and vehicles. These classes are selected to understand the distribution and intensity of the damage. The point clouds consist of two distinct areas assembled using aerial Structure-from-Motion from a camera mounted on an unmanned aerial system. The two datasets contain approximately 5000 and 8000 unique instances, and the developed methods are assessed quantitatively using precision, accuracy, recall, and intersection over union metrics.","2019","2024-01-19 10:21:51","2024-01-19 10:21:51","","","","3","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","deep learning; Hurricane Harvey; point clouds; semantic segmentation; three-dimensional convolutional neural network; unmanned aerial systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, population growth, increased urbanisation, deforestation, and rapid economic development has decidedly modified the surface of the earth, resulting in dramatic land cover changes, which continue to cause significant degradation of environmental attributes. In order to reshape policies and management frameworks conforming to the objectives of the SDG&rsquo;s, it is paramount to understand the driving mechanisms of land use changes and determine future patterns of change. This study aims to assess and quantify future land cover changes in Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by simulating a future landscape for the SDG target year of 2030 in order to provide evidence to support data-driven decision-making processes conforming to the requirements of the SDG&rsquo;s. The study follows six sequential steps: (a) creation of three land cover maps from 2010, 2015 and 2019 derived from satellite images; (b) land change analysis by cross-tabulation of land cover maps; (c) submodel creation and identification of explanatory variables and dataset creation for each variable; (d) calculation of transition potentials of major transitions within the case study area using machine learning algorithms; (e) change quantification and prediction using Markov chain analysis; and (f) prediction of a 2030 land cover. The model was successfully able to simulate future land cover and land use changes and the dynamics conclude that agricultural expansion and urban development is expected to significantly reduce Virunga&rsquo;s forest and open land areas in the next 11 years. Accessibility in terms of landscape topography and proximity to existing human activities are concluded to be primary drivers of these changes. Drawing on these conclusions, the discussion provides recommendations and reflections on how the predicted future land cover changes can be used to support and underpin policy frameworks towards achieving the SDG&rsquo;s and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.","2020","2024-01-19 10:21:51","2024-01-19 10:59:13","","","","4","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","land cover modelling; machine learning; MARKOV-CHAIN; remote sensing; sustainable development goals; Virunga National Park","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the urgent need to incorporate economic and ecological goals in landscape planning, cost-effective conservation strategies are required. In this study, we validated the benefit of fusing imagery from multiple sensors to assess the impact of landscape changes on ecosystem services (ES) and their economic values in the Long County, Shaanxi Province, China. We applied several landscape metrics to assess the local spatial configuration over 15 years (2004–2019) from fused imageries. Using Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor 3 (IRS LISS 3) imageries fused for 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019, we reclassified land use/land cover (LULC) changes, through the rotation forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm. We proposed an equivalent monetary metric for estimating the ES values, which also could be used in the whole China. Results showed that agriculture farmland and unused land decreased their spatial distribution over time, with an observed increase on woodland, grassland, water bodies and built-up area. Our findings suggested that the patterns of landscape uniformity and connectivity improved, while the distribution of landscape types stabilized, while the landscape diversity had a slight improvement. The overall ES values increased (4.34%) under a benefit transfer approach, mainly concerning woodland and grassland. A sensitivity analysis showed the selected economic value (EV) was relevant and suitable for the study area associated with our ES for LULC changes. We suggested that changes in landscape patterns affected the ESV trends, while the increases on some LULC classes slightly improved the landscape diversity. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we recommend that local authorities and environmental practitioners should balance the economic benefits and ecological gains in different landscapes to achieve a sustainable development from local to regional scales.","2021","2024-01-19 10:21:51","2024-01-19 10:21:51","","","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","environmental monitoring; image fusion; landscape patterns; remote sensing; urban ecosystem services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this research is to create a strategy that enables the extraction of indicators from large-scale orthoimages of different resolution with practically acceptable accuracy after a short training process. Remote sensing data can be used to detect changes in number of buildings, forest areas, and other landscape objects. In this paper, aerial images of a digital raster orthophoto map at scale 1:10,000 of the Republic of Lithuania (ORT10LT) of three periods (2009&ndash;2010, 2012&ndash;2013, 2015&ndash;2017) were analyzed. Because of the developing technologies, the quality of the images differs significantly and should be taken into account while preparing the dataset for training the semantic segmentation model DeepLabv3 with a ResNet50 backbone. In the data preparation step, normalization techniques were used to ensure stability of image quality and contrast. Focal loss for the training metric was selected to deal with the misbalanced dataset. The suggested model training process is based on the transfer learning technique and combines using a model with weights pretrained in ImageNet with learning on coarse and fine-tuning datasets. The coarse dataset consists of images with classes generated automatically from Open Street Map (OSM) data and the fine-tuning dataset was created by manually reviewing the images to ensure that the objects in images match the labels. To highlight the benefits of transfer learning, six different models were trained by combining different steps of the suggested model training process. It is demonstrated that using pretrained weights results in improved performance of the model and the best performance was demonstrated by the model which includes all three steps of the training process (pretrained weights, training on coarse and fine-tuning datasets). Finally, the results obtained with the created machine learning model enable the implementation of different approaches to detect, analyze, and interpret urban changes for policymakers and investors on different levels on a local map, grid, or municipality level.","2022","2024-01-19 10:21:52","2024-01-19 10:21:52","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aerial images; transfer learning; urban change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results showed that phenological parameters were found to be the most influential in soil-suitability prediction. The validation of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve approach indicates an area under the curve and an AUC of more than 0.82 for all models. The best results were obtained using the XgbTree with an AUC = 0.97 in comparison to other MLA. Our findings demonstrate an excellent ability for ML models to predict the soil-suitability using physico-chemical and phenological parameters.

Combining machine learning with the random forest algorithm (RF) improved vegetation classification accuracy while reducing computation time. The study findings demonstrated how the SUHI affected Moscow&rsquo;s territory and showed the urban areas significantly impacted by this phenomenon. The locations of surface urban heat islands in Moscow and areas affected by SUHI and UPI were identified using numerical modeling of the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI).

The study area’s top three models for county-level corn yield prediction were PLSR, support vector regression (SVR) and ridge regression. For in-season yield prediction, the SVR model performed comparatively well by achieving testing R2 = 0.875. For in-season corn yield prediction, SVR outperformed other models. The results show that machine learning models can predict both in-season yield (best model R2 = 0.875) and end-of-season yield (best model R2 = 0.861) with satisfactory performance. The results indicate that remote sensing data and machine learning models can be used to predict crop yield before the harvest with decent performance. This can provide useful insights in terms of food security and early decision making related to climate change impacts on food security.","2023-12","2024-01-19 10:22:40","2024-01-19 10:37:41","","","","1","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2905421931","","","Place: Cagiari Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd.","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/H64sW?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=DNY%2FUkwx9p%2FFzRczdIEqNdj19VM%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=County-level+corn+yield+prediction+using+supervised+machine+learning&title=European+Journal+of+Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-12-01&volume=56&issue=1&spage=&au=Shahid+Nawaz+Khan%3BAbid+Nawaz+Khan%3BAqil+Tariq%3BLu%2C+Linlin%3BNaeem+Abbas+Malik%3BUmair%2C+Muhammad%3BWesam+Atef+Hatamleh%3BFarah+Hanna+Zawaideh&isbn=&jtitle=European+Journal+of+Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F22797254.2023.2253985","Agricultural production; Climate change; Corn; Corn yield; Crop growth; Crop yield; Earth Sciences; Environmental impact; food security; Food security; Machine learning; Modelling; MODIS; Regression; Remote sensing; Seasons; Spectroradiometers; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Vegetables; Vegetation; Vegetation index; vegetation indices; yield prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HABs can harm humans and animals through their toxicity or by producing ecological conditions such as oxygen depletion, which can kill fish and other economically or ecologically important organisms. This review summarizes the reports on various HABs that are able to bring about marine fish kills. The predominant HABs, their toxins, and their effects on fishes spread across various parts of the globe are discussed. The mechanism of HAB-driven fish kills is discussed based on the available reports, and existing mitigation methods are presented. Lapses in the large-scale implementation of mitigation methods demonstrated under laboratory conditions are projected. Clay-related technologies and nano-sorption-based nanotechnologies, although proven to make significant contributions, have not been put to use in real-world conditions. The gaps in the technology transfer of the accomplished mitigation prototypes are highlighted. Further uses of remote sensing and machine learning state-of-the-art techniques for the detection and identification of HABs are recommended.","2023","2024-01-19 10:22:41","2024-01-19 10:58:27","","3936","","23","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2899413514","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/FAgWW?_a=ChgyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo1OTM2OTASBjEwMjAyMBoKT05FX1NFQVJDSCIOMTMyLjIyOS45Mi4xMDAqBzIwMzIzNDcyCjI4OTk0MTM1MTQ6DURvY3VtZW50SW1hZ2VCATBSBk9ubGluZVoCRlRiA1BGVGoKMjAyMy8wMS8wMXIKMjAyMy8xMi8zMXoAggEhUC0xMDA5MjQwLTEyMDQ1LUZSRUUtbnVsbC02NDU0ODk3kgEGT25saW5lygF1TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKE1hY2ludG9zaDsgSW50ZWwgTWFjIE9TIFggMTBfMTVfNykgQXBwbGVXZWJLaXQvNTM3LjM2IChLSFRNTCwgbGlrZSBHZWNrbykgQ2hyb21lLzEyMC4wLjAuMCBTYWZhcmkvNTM3LjM20gESU2Nob2xhcmx5IEpvdXJuYWxzmgIHUHJlUGFpZKoCK09TOkVNUy1NZWRpYUxpbmtzU2VydmljZS1nZXRNZWRpYVVybEZvckl0ZW3KAg9BcnRpY2xlfEZlYXR1cmXSAgFZ8gIA%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=TRb%2BN64CgPooF6LZFuDcZVACsqg%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Review+of+Harmful+Algal+Blooms+%28HABs%29+Causing+Marine+Fish+Kills%3A+Toxicity+and+Mitigation&title=Plants&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=12&issue=23&spage=3936&au=Oh%2C+Jae-Wook%3BSuraj+Shiv+Charan+Pushparaj%3BManikandan+Muthu%3BGopal%2C+Judy&isbn=&jtitle=Plants&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fplants12233936","Algae; Algal blooms; Animals; Aquatic ecosystems; Biology--Botany; Commercial fishing; Cyanobacteria; Ecological conditions; environment; Eutrophication; Fish; fish kills; Fisheries; Fishing; Food contamination & poisoning; Freshwater environments; Gulf of Mexico; harmful algal blooms; Hypoxia; Machine learning; marine; Marine fish; Microorganisms; mitigation; Oxygen depletion; Prototypes; Public health; Remote sensing; Seafood; Shellfish; Skin; Technology transfer; Tourism; Toxicity; Toxins; water pollution; Water quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigates remote sensing research on SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) from 2016 to 2023, highlighting the growing interest in the field. By evaluating a large number of selected articles (6820) using a specialized keyword selection strategy and various filters, a significant increase in publication frequency was observed. Remote Sensing and Sustainability were found to be the most relevant journals. A trend towards research addressing urban ecological quality, changes in land use patterns, and the impact of impervious surfaces was found in domain-specific citations. Semi-niche motor themes encompass deep learning, feature extraction, and semantic segmentation. Simultaneously, remote sensing, machine learning, and change detection serve as foundational motor themes, merging elements of both basic and motor themes. The introduction of new analytical methods (e.g., new indices), together with the use of open data and crowdsourcing, has gained great interest. While there has been a strong focus on land cover, urban expansion, and land surface temperature, the main gaps were identified in regional development, disaster, resilience, natural and cultural heritage, housing, and inclusiveness. The findings show the significance of remote sensing research and its practical applications for shaping urban policy, planning strategies, and sustainable urban development. By extracting research patterns using centrality and density analyses and identifying underexplored areas, valuable insights into relationships, significance, and developmental progress within SDG 11-related remote sensing research were gained and may contribute to future planning and informing policymaking decisions.","2023","2024-01-19 10:21:52","2024-01-19 10:46:02","","16094","","22","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2893384868","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/HBxLW?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=XhMhVDt5hclTIdhYWm6%2Bs1MSXFw%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=From+Pixels+to+Sustainability%3A+Trends+and+Collaborations+in+Remote+Sensing+for+Advancing+Sustainable+Cities+and+Communities+%28SDG+11%29&title=Sustainability&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=22&spage=16094&au=Ekmen%2C+Omer%3BSultan+Kocaman&isbn=&jtitle=Sustainability&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsu152216094","bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics; Cities; Earth; Earth observation; Environmental Studies; INDEX; Interdisciplinary aspects; Keywords; Land settlement; Population; Publications; remote sensing; Remote sensing; research trends; Science; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal 11; Trends; Urban areas; Urban development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Environmental issues, such as climate change and ecosystem destruction, pose significant threats to humanity and the planet. Addressing these challenges necessitates sustainable resource management and increased efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) and ML technologies present promising solutions in this regard. By harnessing AI and ML, we can collect and analyze vast amounts of data from diverse sources, such as remote sensing, smart sensors, and social media. This enables real-time monitoring and decision making in water resource management. AI applications, including irrigation optimization, water quality monitoring, flood forecasting, and water demand forecasting, enhance agricultural practices, water distribution models, and decision making in desalination plants. Furthermore, AI facilitates data integration, supports decision-making processes, and enhances overall water management sustainability. However, the wider adoption of AI in water resource management faces challenges, such as data heterogeneity, stakeholder education, and high costs. To provide an overview of ML applications in water resource management, this research focuses on core fundamentals, major applications (prediction, clustering, and reinforcement learning), and ongoing issues to offer new insights. More specifically, after the in-depth illustration of the ML algorithmic taxonomy, we provide a comparative mapping of all ML methodologies to specific water management tasks. At the same time, we include a tabulation of such research works along with some concrete, yet compact, descriptions of their objectives at hand. By leveraging ML tools, we can develop sustainable water resource management plans and address the world’s water supply concerns effectively.","2023","2024-01-19 10:22:42","2024-01-19 10:25:51","","12147","","22","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2892975138","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/OXWLW?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=dIP%2FWMomuW9%2Fe40blSD8Fk5D2yU%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=A+Comprehensive+Survey+of+Machine+Learning+Methodologies+with+Emphasis+in+Water+Resources+Management&title=Applied+Sciences&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=13&issue=22&spage=12147&au=Drogkoula%2C+Maria%3BKokkinos%2C+Konstantinos%3BSamaras%2C+Nicholas&isbn=&jtitle=Applied+Sciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fapp132212147","AI; Algorithms; classification; Classification; climate change; Climate change; clustering; Combinatorics; data analysis; Data collection; Data mining; decision making; Decision making; ecosystem destruction; Forecasting; Machine learning; machine learning (ML); Methods; Neural networks; Population growth; prediction; regression; Regression analysis; Sciences: Comprehensive Works; Social networks; supervised learning; Support vector machines; sustainability; Sustainable development; unsupervised learning; Urban areas; water efficiency; Water quality; Water resources management; water resources management (WRM); Water shortages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lately, new technology-based methods using satellites and unmanned vehicles, among others have emerged as tools to aid the governance of these ecosystems by providing managers with high-quality data for decision-making processes. This paper addresses the development of a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-based application for use in the management processes of shallow coral reef ecosystems, using images acquired with Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) known as drones, at the Old Providence McBean Lagoon National Natural Park; a Marine Protected Area (MPA) located northwest of Old Providence Island, Colombia. Image acquisition and processing, known as drone imagery, is first described for flights performed using an RTK multispectral drone at five different monitoring stations within the MPA. Then, the use of the GEE app is described and illustrated. The user executes four simple steps starting with the selection of the orthomosaics uploaded to GEE and obtaining the reef habitat classification for four categories: coral, macroalgae, sand, and rubble, at any of the five monitoring stations. Results show that these classes can be effectively mapped using different machine-learning (ML) algorithms available inside GEE, helping the manager obtain high-quality information about the reef. This remote-sensing application represents an easy-to-use tool for managers that can be integrated into modern ecosystem monitoring protocols, supporting effective reef governance within a digitized society with more demanding stakeholders.","2023","2024-01-19 10:22:42","2024-01-19 10:42:05","","3504","","14","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2843103260","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/LvGYT?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=WMA8URzeiNyy2UNGRzpX9jC6W6k%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Development+of+a+Google+Earth+Engine-Based+Application+for+the+Management+of+Shallow+Coral+Reefs+Using+Drone+Imagery&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=14&spage=3504&au=Zapata-Ram%C3%ADrez%2C+Paula+A%3BHern%C3%A1ndez-Ham%C3%B3n%2C+Hernando%3BFitzsimmons%2C+Clare%3BCano%2C+Marcela%3BGarc%C3%ADa%2C+Juli%C3%A1n%3BZuluaga%2C+Carlos+A%3BV%C3%A1squez%2C+Rafael+E&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15143504","Algae; Algorithms; Australia; Climate change; Colombia; Coral reef ecosystems; coral reefs; Coral reefs; Decision making; Drone aircraft; drone imagery; Ecological monitoring; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; environmental monitoring; google earth engine; Image acquisition; Lagoons; machine learning; Machine learning; Managers; marine ecosystem management; Marine protected areas; New technology; Old Providence; Physics; Protected areas; remote sensing; Remote sensing; Remotely piloted aircraft; Sensors; Strategic management; Unmanned vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These efforts are especially important in tropical countries where technical capacity is limited. Land cover legend specification is a critical first step when mapping land cover, with consequences for its subsequent use and interpretation of results. We integrated the temporal metrics of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and multispectral data (Sentinel-1 and Sentienel-2) with visual pixel classifications and field surveys using five machine learning algorithms that apply different statistical methods to assess the prediction and mapping of two different land cover legends at a high spatial resolution (10 m) in a tropical region with seasonal flooding. The evaluated legends were CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) and ECOSO, a legend that we defined based on the ecological and socio-economic conditions of the study area. Compared with previous studies, we obtained high accuracies for land cover modeling (kappa = 0.82) and land cover mapping (kappa = 0.76) when using ECOSO. We also found that the CORINE legend generated lower accuracies than the ECOSO legend (kappa = 0.79 for land cover modeling and kappa = 0.61 for the land cover mapping). Although CORINE was developed for European environments, it is the official land cover legend of Colombia, a South American country with tropical ecosystems not found in Europe. Therefore, some of the CORINE classes have ambiguous definitions for the study area, explaining the lower accuracy of its modeling and mapping. We used free and open-access data and software in this research; thus, our methods can be applied in other tropical regions.","2023","2024-01-19 10:22:43","2024-01-19 10:28:41","","2522","","10","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2819481963","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/X20oR?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=BuvOdR22ziCYRzBaxNzdSRfG%2F64%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Advancing+High-Resolution+Land+Cover+Mapping+in+Colombia%3A+The+Importance+of+a+Locally+Appropriate+Legend&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=10&spage=2522&au=J+Camilo+Fagua%3BRodr%C3%ADguez-Buritic%C3%A1%2C+Susana%3BJantz%2C+Patrick&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs15102522","Accuracy; Algorithms; Colombia; CORINE; Deforestation; Economic conditions; Europe; Forests; Guerrilla forces; High resolution; International agreements; land cover; Land cover; Land use; Machine learning; Mapping; Maps; Model accuracy; Modelling; Natural resource management; Natural resources; Physics; Random Forest; Remote sensing; Resource management; Sentienel-2; Sentinel-1; Socioeconomic factors; Socioeconomics; Spatial discrimination; spatial modeling; Spatial resolution; Statistical methods; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Tropical environment; Tropical environments; Visual fields; wetlands; Wetlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary objective of this study is to delineate lake area extent, utilizing a machine learning approach, and to examine the impact of these hydro-climatological factors on lake dynamics. In situ and remote sensing observations were employed to identify the predominant explanatory pathways for assessing the fluctuations in lake area. The Great Salt Lake (GSL) and Lake Chad (LC) were chosen as study sites due to their semi-arid regional settings, enabling the testing of the proposed approach. The random forest (RF) supervised classification algorithm was applied to estimate the lake area extent using Landsat imagery that was acquired between 1999 and 2021. The long-term lake dynamics were evaluated using remotely sensed evapotranspiration data that were derived from MODIS, precipitation data that were sourced from CHIRPS, and in situ water level measurements. The findings revealed a marked decline in the GSL area extent, exceeding 50% between 1999 and 2021, whereas LC exhibited greater fluctuations with a comparatively lower decrease in its area extent, which was approximately 30% during the same period. The framework that is presented in this study demonstrates the reliability of remote sensing data and machine learning methodologies for monitoring lacustrine dynamics. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights for decision makers and water resource managers in assessing the temporal variability of lake dynamics.","2023","2024-01-19 10:22:44","2024-01-19 10:49:00","","78","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2806548741","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/xH5QR?_a=ChgyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo1OTM2OTASBjEwMjAyMBoKT05FX1NFQVJDSCIOMTMyLjIyOS45Mi4xMDAqBzIwNTU0MDYyCjI4MDY1NDg3NDE6DURvY3VtZW50SW1hZ2VCATBSBk9ubGluZVoCRlRiA1BGVGoKMjAyMy8wMS8wMXIKMjAyMy8xMi8zMXoAggEhUC0xMDA5MjQwLTEyMDQ1LUZSRUUtbnVsbC02NDU0ODk3kgEGT25saW5lygF1TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKE1hY2ludG9zaDsgSW50ZWwgTWFjIE9TIFggMTBfMTVfNykgQXBwbGVXZWJLaXQvNTM3LjM2IChLSFRNTCwgbGlrZSBHZWNrbykgQ2hyb21lLzEyMC4wLjAuMCBTYWZhcmkvNTM3LjM20gESU2Nob2xhcmx5IEpvdXJuYWxzmgIHUHJlUGFpZKoCK09TOkVNUy1NZWRpYUxpbmtzU2VydmljZS1nZXRNZWRpYVVybEZvckl0ZW3KAg9BcnRpY2xlfEZlYXR1cmXSAgFZ8gIA%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=a7exXcAqOqFw6FhR8HICKApOQcc%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Integrating+Satellite+Imagery+and+Ground-Based+Measurements+with+a+Machine+Learning+Model+for+Monitoring+Lake+Dynamics+over+a+Semi-Arid+Region&title=Hydrology&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=10&issue=4&spage=78&au=Ekpetere%2C+Kenneth%3BMohamed%2C+Abdelkader%3BIshaya%2C+Sunday%3BMakwe%2C+Edith%3BEkpetere%2C+Peter&isbn=&jtitle=Hydrology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fhydrology10040078","Accuracy; Algorithms; Arid regions; Arid zones; Automation; China; CHIRPS; Climate change; Decision trees; Dynamics; Earth observations (from space); Earth Sciences--Hydrology; Evapotranspiration; Fluctuations; Great Salt Lake; Hydrologic data; Hydrology; Image acquisition; Inland waters; Lake Chad; lake dynamics; Lake dynamics; Lakes; Landsat; Landsat satellites; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Measurement techniques; MODIS; Monitoring; Precipitation; Regions; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Semi arid areas; Semiarid lands; Surface water; Sustainable development; Temporal variations; Water depth; Water levels; Water resources; Water resources management; Water shortages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flood prediction tools are critical for flood hazard and risk management. However, numerous reviews on flood modelling have focused on individual models. This study presents a state-of-the-art review of flood prediction tools with a focus on analyzing the chronological growth of the research in the field of flood prediction, the evolutionary trends in flood prediction, analysing the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, and finally identifying the significant gaps for future studies. The article conducted a review and meta-analysis of 1101 research articles indexed by the Scopus database in the last five years (2017–2022) using Biblioshiny in r. The study drew an up-to-date picture of the recent developments, emerging topical trends, and gaps for future studies. The finding shows that machine learning models are widely used in flood prediction, while Probabilistic models like Copula and Bayesian Network (B.N.) play significant roles in the uncertainty assessment of flood risk, and should be explored since these events are uncertain. It was also found that the advancement of the remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) and cloud computing provides the best platform to integrate data and tools for flood prediction. However, more research should be conducted in Africa, South Africa and Australia, where less work is done and the potential of the probabilistic models in flood prediction should be explored.","2023","2024-01-19 10:22:45","2024-01-19 10:54:03","","427","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2774952803","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/84siQ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=1IwTkFAGlFokQI55toZ5LGi2em8%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Know+to+Predict%2C+Forecast+to+Warn%3A+A+Review+of+Flood+Risk+Prediction+Tools&title=Water&issn=&date=2023-01-01&volume=15&issue=3&spage=427&au=Kwesi+Twum+Antwi-Agyakwa%3BMawuli+Kwaku+Afenyo%3BAngnuureng%2C+Donatus+Bapentire&isbn=&jtitle=Water&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fw15030427","Bayesian analysis; Bias; bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics; Biblioshiny; Climate change; Databases; Environmental risk; Environmental Studies; Flood; Flood forecasting; flood hazard; Flood hazards; Flood management; flood prediction tools; Flood predictions; Flood risk; Floods; Geographic information systems; Geographical information systems; GIS; Hydrology; Information systems; Infrastructure; machine learning; Machine learning; Mathematical models; meta-analysis; Meta-analysis; numerical model; Predictions; probabilistic model; Probability theory; Remote sensing; Research; Reviews; Risk management; Scientometrics; Scopus; Search engines; Search strategies; State-of-the-art reviews; Storm damage; Systematic review; Tools; Trends; Weather; Webometrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study developed the Neuro-Fuzzy-AHP (NFAHP) technique for fusing remote sensing (i.e., ASTER alteration mineral image-maps) and geological datasets (i.e., lithological map, geochronological map, structural map, and geochemical map) to identify high potential zones of volcanic massive sulfide (VMS) copper mineralization in the Sahlabad mining area, east Iran. Argillic, phyllic, propylitic and gossan alteration zones were identified in the study area using band ratio and Selective Principal Components Analysis (SPCA) methods implemented to ASTER VNIR and SWIR bands. For each of the copper deposits, old mines and mineralization indices in the study area, information related to exploration factors such as ore mineralization, host-rock lithology, alterations, geochronological, geochemistry, and distance from high intensity lineament factor communities were investigated. Subsequently, the predictive power of these factors in identifying copper occurrences was evaluated using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) technique. The BPNN results demonstrated that using the exploration factors, copper mineralizations in Sahlabad mining area could be identified with high accuracy. Lastly, using the Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP) method, information layers were weighted and fused. As a result, a potential map of copper mineralization was generated, which pinpointed several high potential zones in the study area. For verification of the results, the documented copper deposits, old mines, and mineralization indices in the study area were plotted on the potential map, which is particularly appearing in high favorability parts of the potential map. In conclusion, the Neuro-Fuzzy-AHP (NFAHP) technique shows great reliability for copper exploration in the Sahlabad mining area, and it can be extrapolated to other metallogenic provinces in Iran and other regions for the reconnaissance stage of mineral exploration.","2022","2024-01-19 10:22:45","2024-01-19 10:56:02","","5562","","21","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2771659924","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/tE1yQ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=mB8tC0L2WKSYZFCy9pgQpjIdtls%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Neuro-Fuzzy-AHP+%28NFAHP%29+Technique+for+Copper+Exploration+Using+Advanced+Spaceborne+Thermal+Emission+and+Reflection+Radiometer+%28ASTER%29+and+Geological+Datasets+in+the+Sahlabad+Mining+Area%2C+East+Iran&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=21&spage=5562&au=Shirazi%2C+Aref%3BHezarkhani%2C+Ardeshir%3BAmin+Beiranvand+Pour%3BShirazy%2C+Adel%3BHashim%2C+Mazlan&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14215562","Accuracy; Algorithms; Analytic hierarchy process; Artificial neural networks; Aster; ASTER; ASTER (radiometer); Back propagation; Back propagation networks; BPNN; Copper; copper exploration; Datasets; Fault lines; Fuzzy logic; Geochemistry; Geochronology; geological data; Geological mapping; Geology; Information processing; Iran; Lithology; machine learning; Machine learning; Mapping; Mineral exploration; mineral potential map; Mineralization; Mines; Neural networks; NFAHP; Physics; Principal components analysis; Propagation; Reconnaissance; Remote sensing; Software; Thermal emission; United States--US","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The agricultural industry is one of the world’s most important industries, and it is critical to the achievement of the SDGs. The second major aspect of the SDGs, i.e., zero hunger, addresses food security (SDG 2). To measure the status of food security, accurate statistics on paddy production must be accessible. Paddy phenological classification is a way to determine a food plant’s growth phase. Imbalanced data are a common occurrence in agricultural data, and machine learning is frequently utilized as a technique for classification issues. The current trend in agriculture is to use remote sensing data to classify crops. This paper proposes a new approach—one that uses two phases in the bootstrap stage of the random forest method—called a two-phase stratified random forest (TPSRF). The simulation scenario shows that the proposed TPSRF outperforms CART, SVM, and RF. Furthermore, in its application to paddy growth phase data for 2019 in Lamongan Regency, East Java, Indonesia, the proposed TPSRF showed higher overall accuracy (OA) than the compared methods.","2022","2024-01-19 10:21:52","2024-01-19 11:00:21","","15252","","22","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2739475626","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/8eQ1Q?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=f74t%2Bh6x99FlclDpr0BHH1bZKXI%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Two-Phase+Stratified+Random+Forest+for+Paddy+Growth+Phase+Classification%3A+A+Case+of+Imbalanced+Data&title=Sustainability&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=22&spage=15252&au=Hady+Suryono%3BHeri+Kuswanto%3BIriawan%2C+Nur&isbn=&jtitle=Sustainability&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsu142215252","Agriculture; Algorithms; Altitude; Big Data; classification; Classification; data imbalance; Development policy; Environmental Studies; Flowers & plants; Food security; Hunger; Indonesia; MACHINE; Machine learning; paddy phenology; PERFORMANCE; Phenology; Random forest; Remote sensing; Rice; SELECTION; Support vector machines; Sustainability; Sustainable development; sustainable development goals; two-phase stratified random forest; Vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changing environmental conditions and inadequate land management are endangering soil quality and productivity and, in turn, crop quality and productivity are affected. Advances in hyperspectral remote sensing are of great use for the spatial characterization and monitoring of the soil degradation status, as well as its impact on crop growth and agricultural productivity. In this study, hyperspectral airborne data covering the visible, near-infrared, short-wave infrared, and thermal infrared (VNIR–SWIR–TIR, 0.4–12 µm) were acquired in a Mediterranean agricultural area of central Spain and used to analyze the spatial differences in vegetation vitality and grain yield in relation to the soil degradation status. Specifically, leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress index (CWSI), and the biomass of the crop yield are derived from the remote sensing data and discussed regarding their spatial differences and relationship to a classification of erosion and accumulation stages (SEAS) based on previous remote sensing analyses during bare soil conditions. LAI and harvested crop biomass yield could be well estimated by PLS regression based on the hyperspectral and in situ reference data (R2 of 0.83, r of 0.91, and an RMSE of 0.2 m2 m−2 for LAI and an R2 of 0.85, r of 0.92, and an RMSE of 0.48 t ha−1 for grain yield). In addition, the soil erosion and accumulation stages (SEAS) were successfully predicted based on the canopy spectral signal of vegetated crop fields using a random forest machine learning approach. Overall accuracy was achieved above 71% by combining the VNIR–SWIR–TIR canopy reflectance and emissivity of the growing season with topographic information after reducing the redundancy in the spectral dataset. The results show that the estimated crop traits are spatially related to the soil’s degradation status, with shallow and highly eroded soils, as well as sandy accumulation zones being associated with areas of low LAI, crop yield, and high crop water stress. Overall, the results of this study illustrate the enormous potential of imaging spectroscopy for a combined analysis of the plant-soil system in the frame of land and soil degradation monitoring.","2022","2024-01-19 10:22:46","2024-01-19 10:29:24","","5131","","20","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2728528258","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/B2yaP?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=lO%2BiBBm2V38V1F0L7wxhmtF1VxU%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Analyses+of+the+Impact+of+Soil+Conditions+and+Soil+Degradation+on+Vegetation+Vitality+and+Crop+Productivity+Based+on+Airborne+Hyperspectral+VNIR%26ndash%3BSWIR%26ndash%3BTIR+Data+in+a+Semi-Arid+Rainfed+Agricultural+Area+%28Camarena%2C+Central+Spain%29&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=20&spage=5131&au=Milewski%2C+Robert%3BSchmid%2C+Thomas%3BChabrillat%2C+Sabine%3BJim%C3%A9nez%2C+Marcos%3BEscribano%2C+Paula%3BPelayo%2C+Marta%3BBen-Dor%2C+Eyal&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14205131","Accumulation; Agricultural production; Agricultural productivity; Agriculture; Biomass; Canopies; Cellulose; Cereals; Climate change; Crop fields; Crop growth; Crop production; crop productivity; Crop yield; Crops; Emissivity; Environmental changes; Environmental conditions; Environmental degradation; Environmental monitoring; Erosion; Food; Grain; Growing season; hyperspectral imagery; Impact analysis; LAI; Land management; Leaf area; Leaf area index; Lignin; Machine learning; Mediterranean; Monitoring; Physics; Physiology; Productivity; Redundancy; Regions; Remote sensing; Sandy soils; Short wave radiation; Soil conditions; soil degradation; Soil degradation; Soil erosion; Soil fertility; Soil management; Soil quality; Spain; Spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; SWIR; Triticale; Vegetation; vegetation traits; VNIR; water stress; Water stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Above-ground biomass (AGB) is the largest carbon pool in most forest systems, and the quickest to change following disturbance. Quantifying AGB on a global scale and being able to reliably map how it is changing, is therefore required for tackling climate change by targeting and monitoring policies. AGB can be mapped using remote sensing and machine learning methods, but such maps have high uncertainties, and simply subtracting one from another does not give a reliable indication of changes. To improve the quantification of AGB changes it is necessary to add advanced statistical methodology to existing machine learning and remote sensing methods. This review discusses the areas in which techniques used in statistical research could positively impact AGB quantification. Nine global or continental AGB maps, and a further eight local AGB maps, were investigated in detail to understand the limitations of techniques currently used. It was found that both modelling and validation of maps lacked spatial consideration. Spatial cross validation or other sampling methods, which specifically account for the spatial nature of this data, are important to introduce into AGB map validation. Modelling techniques which capture the spatial nature should also be used. For example, spatial random effects can be included in various forms of hierarchical statistical models. These can be estimated using frequentist or Bayesian inference. Strategies including hierarchical modelling, Bayesian inference, and simulation methods can also be applied to improve uncertainty estimation. Additionally, if these uncertainties are visualised using pixelation or contour maps this could improve interpretation. Improved uncertainty, which is commonly between 30% and 40%, is in addition needed to produce accurate change maps which will benefit policy decisions, policy implementation, and our understanding of the carbon cycle.","2022","2024-01-19 10:22:47","2024-01-19 10:46:28","","4911","","19","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Coronavirus Research Database; Publicly Available Content Database","2724308244","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/62uCP?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=08%2BDbfRuZgKQChu57%2Fq%2BbBvTRIU%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Improving+Estimates+and+Change+Detection+of+Forest+Above-Ground+Biomass+Using+Statistical+Methods&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=19&spage=4911&au=Turton%2C+Amber+E%3BAugustin%2C+Nicole+H%3BMitchard%2C+Edward+T+A&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14194911","above-ground biomass; Atmospheric models; Bayesian analysis; Bayesian inference; Biomass; Carbon; carbon cycle; Carbon cycle; Carbon sequestration; change detection; Change detection; Climate change; Forest; Forest biomass; forest degradation; Forests; Human impact; Land degradation; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Maps; Mathematical models; modelling; Physics; remote sensing; Remote sensing; Sampling methods; Sensors; spatial modelling; Statistical analysis; Statistical inference; Statistical methods; Statistical models; statistics; Uncertainty; uncertainty propagation; validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because land cover data are developed by a variety of organizations for a range of objectives, they are based on different classification schemes and have discrepancies. In addition, the sustainability for land cover is hampered by limited access to information and documentation. Accordingly, international standards for land cover are developed to improve interoperability between different land cover datasets. However, the use and development of land cover datasets are limited by various factors including availability of properly documented land cover legends in support of different applications including change assessment, comparison, and international reporting. The purpose of this article is to highlight the importance of land cover in achieving several goals and to introduce the first international platform for land cover legend, named Land Cover Legend Registry (LCLR). This registry is a contribution to the international land cover community and the UN in effort to promote and support data harmonization processes and interoperability from local to global level, and vice versa. Users can not only use the registry for preparing consistent datasets, but also contribute to it by providing the latest data to ensure the long-term availability of both updated and existing datasets around the world. Moreover, building on the experience developing land cover legends with different nations, a brief explanation on the preparation of legends is also provided. Additionally, it is more important than ever to develop land cover registers to support the use, expansion, integration, and use uptake of land cover data, particularly for innovative remote sensing, machine learning, and information and communication technologies and techniques that build on existing and national contexts.","2022","2024-01-19 10:21:52","2024-01-19 10:29:20","","1083","","7","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2694015730","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/VLakN?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=fhAvLV%2Frms02TK656%2FV4ypOEOVs%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=An+International+Library+for+Land+Cover+Legends%3A+The+Land+Cover+Legend+Registry&title=Land&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=11&issue=7&spage=1083&au=Mushtaq%2C+Fatima%3BMatieu+Henry%3BC+Douglas+O%E2%80%99Brien%3BAntonio+Di+Gregorio%3BRashed+Jalal%3BLatham%2C+John%3BMuchoney%2C+Douglas%3BHill%2C+Chris+T%3BMosca%2C+Nicola%3BTefera%2C+Michael+Golmame%3BMorteo%2C+Karl%3BFranceschini%2C+Gianluca%3BGhosh%2C+Amit%3BTchana%2C+Elisee%3BChen%2C+Zhongxin&isbn=&jtitle=Land&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fland11071083","Agriculture; Availability; CARBON BUDGET; classification; Classification; Classification schemes; Climate change; Conservation; Datasets; Documentation; geospatial; harmonization; Information dissemination; International organizations; International standards; interoperability; Interoperability; Land; Land cover; Land use; Machine learning; Nations; Natural resources; Remote sensing; semantic ontology; Software; standards; Sustainability; Sustainable development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various digital soil mapping approaches based on either single-period remote sensing or spectral indices in other ecosystems usually produce inaccurate, poorly constrained estimates of dryland SOM. Here, a framework for spatially-detailed SOM mapping was proposed based on cross-wavelet transform (XWT) that exploits ecologically meaningful features from intra-annual fractional vegetation and soil-related endmember records. In this framework, paired green vegetation (GV) and soil-related endmembers (i.e., dark surface (DA), saline land (SA), sand land (SL)) sequences were adopted to extract 30 XWT features in temporally and spatially continuous domains of cross-wavelet spectrum. We then selected representative features as exploratory covariates for SOM mapping, integrated with four state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, i.e., ridge regression (RR), least squares-support vector machines (LS-SVM), random forests (RF), and gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT). The results reported that SOM maps from 13 coupled filtered XWT features and four machine learning approaches were consistent with soil-landscape knowledge, as evidenced by a spatially-detailed gradient from oasis to barren. This framework also presented more accurate and reliable results than arithmetically averaged features of intra-annual endmembers and existing datasets. Among the four approaches, both RF and GBRT were more appropriate in the XWT-based framework, showing superior accuracy, robustness, and lower uncertainty. The XWT synthetically characterized soil fertility from the consecutive structure of intra-annual vegetation and soil-related endmember sequences. Therefore, the proposed framework improved the understanding of SOM and land degradation neutrality, potentially leading to more sustainable management of dryland systems.","2022","2024-01-19 10:22:48","2024-01-19 10:27:40","","1701","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2649067812","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/67AQV?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=DtiX3PSO4E%2BrPthUS67RtryC7MU%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=A+Remotely+Sensed+Framework+for+Spatially-Detailed+Dryland+Soil+Organic+Matter+Mapping%3A+Coupled+Cross-Wavelet+Transform+with+Fractional+Vegetation+and+Soil-Related+Endmember+Time+Series&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=7&spage=1701&au=Sun%2C+Qiangqiang%3BZhang%2C+Ping%3BJiao%2C+Xin%3BLun%2C+Fei%3BDong%2C+Shiwei%3BLin%2C+Xin%3BLi%2C+Xiangyu%3BSun%2C+Danfeng&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14071701","Agricultural production; Arid zones; Barren lands; Carbon; China; cross-wavelet transform; Digital mapping; dryland systems; Drylands; endmember fraction; Estimates; Feature extraction; Land degradation; Land use; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Organic matter; Organic soils; Physics; Precipitation; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sequences; Soil fertility; Soil mapping; soil organic matter; Soil organic matter; Structure-function relationships; Support vector machines; Sustainability management; time series; Time series; Vegetation; Vegetation mapping; Wavelet transforms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to inaccessibility and a lack of ground measurement networks, accurate quantification of snow water storage in mountainous terrains still remains a major challenge. Remote sensing can provide dynamic observations with extensive spatial coverage, and has proved a useful means to characterize snow water equivalent (SWE) at a large scale. However, current SWE products show very low quality in the mountainous areas due to very coarse spatial resolution, complex terrain, large spatial heterogeneity and deep snow. With more high-quality satellite data becoming available from the development of satellite sensors and platforms, it provides more opportunities for better estimation of snow conditions. Meanwhile, machine learning provides an important technique for handling the big data offered from remote sensing. Using the Överuman Catchment in Northern Sweden as a case study, this paper explores the potentials of machine learning for improving the estimation of mountain snow water storage using satellite observations, topographic factors, land cover information and ground SWE measurements from the spatially distributed snow survey. The results show that significantly improved SWE estimation close to the peak of snow accumulation can be achieved in the catchment using the random forest regression. This study demonstrates the potentials of machine learning for better understanding the snow water storage in mountainous areas.","2021-08","2024-01-19 10:22:48","2024-01-19 10:46:31","","","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2557523169","","","Place: Bristol Publisher: IOP Publishing","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/syp6K?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=fKYhNzw%2Feq7VWSYuZNqxFjfQIyM%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Improving+the+snowpack+monitoring+in+the+mountainous+areas+of+Sweden+from+space%3A+a+machine+learning+approach&title=Environmental+Research+Letters&issn=&date=2021-08-01&volume=16&issue=8&spage=&au=Zhang%2C+Jie%3BPohjola%2C+Veijo+A%3BPettersson%2C+Rickard%3BNorell%2C+Bj%C3%B6rn%3BWolf-Dietrich+Marchand%3BClemenzi%2C+Ilaria%3BGustafsson%2C+David&isbn=&jtitle=Environmental+Research+Letters&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1088%2F1748-9326%2Fabfe8d","Environmental Studies; Flood management; Forest watersheds; Heterogeneity; Hydroelectric power; Land cover; Land use; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mountainous areas; Mountains; Remote sensing; Resource management; Risk assessment; Risk management; Satellite observation; Satellites; Snow; Snow accumulation; Snow-water equivalent; Snowpack; Spatial discrimination; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial resolution; Sweden; Water management; Water resources; Water resources management; Water storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our findings are then used to make a series of pragmatic suggestions for mitigating the most extreme SDG risks associated with brick production in ways that can improve human lives and human freedom.","2021-05","2024-01-19 10:22:49","2024-01-19 10:46:46","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2527370741","","","Place: London Publisher: Palgrave Macmillan","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/aEDFJ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=JKF1pDVeAOiBjNvEz%2FWQ5MM4A4k%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Informing+action+for+United+Nations+SDG+target+8.7+and+interdependent+SDGs%3A+Examining+modern+slavery+from+space&title=Humanities+%26+Social+Sciences+Communications&issn=&date=2021-05-01&volume=8&issue=1&spage=&au=Boyd%2C+Doreen+S%3BPerrat+Bertrand%3BLi%2C+Xiaodong%3BJackson%2C+Bethany%3BLandman%2C+Todd%3BFeng%2C+Ling%3BBales%2C+Kevin%3BChoi-Fitzpatrick%2C+Austin%3BGoulding%2C+James%3BMarsh%2C+Stuart%3BFoody%2C+Giles+M&isbn=&jtitle=Humanities+%26+Social+Sciences+Communications&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1057%2Fs41599-021-00792-z","BRICK KILNS; Climate change; GREATER DHAKA REGION; MODIS; Slavery; Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works; Sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goals; Urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the last decade, there has been increasing attention towards developing new tools and methods for the mapping and classification of wetlands using remote sensing. At the same time, advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly deep learning models, have provided opportunities to advance wetland classification methods. However, the developed deep and very deep algorithms require a higher number of training samples, which is costly, logistically demanding, and time-consuming. As such, in this study, we propose a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that uses a modified architecture of the well-known DCNN of the AlexNet and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation and classification of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Applying to an area of approximately 370 sq. km in the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland, the proposed model with an average accuracy of 92.30% resulted in F-1 scores of 0.82, 0.85, 0.87, 0.89, and 0.95 for the recognition of swamp, fen, marsh, bog, and shallow water, respectively. Moreover, the proposed DCNN model improved the F-1 score of bog, marsh, fen, and swamp wetland classes by 4%, 8%, 11%, and 26%, respectively, compared to the original CNN network of AlexNet. These results reveal that the proposed model is highly capable of the generation and classification of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 wetland samples and can be used for large-extent classification problems.","2021","2024-01-19 10:22:49","2024-01-19 10:27:49","","3601","","24","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2612854147","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/IrqrL?_a=ChgyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo1OTM2OTASBjEwMjAyMBoKT05FX1NFQVJDSCIOMTMyLjIyOS45Mi4xMDAqBzIwMzIzMTgyCjI2MTI4NTQxNDc6DURvY3VtZW50SW1hZ2VCATBSBk9ubGluZVoCRlRiA1BGVGoKMjAyMS8wMS8wMXIKMjAyMS8xMi8zMXoAggEhUC0xMDA5MjQwLTEyMDQ1LUZSRUUtbnVsbC02NDU0ODk3kgEGT25saW5lygF1TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKE1hY2ludG9zaDsgSW50ZWwgTWFjIE9TIFggMTBfMTVfNykgQXBwbGVXZWJLaXQvNTM3LjM2IChLSFRNTCwgbGlrZSBHZWNrbykgQ2hyb21lLzEyMC4wLjAuMCBTYWZhcmkvNTM3LjM20gESU2Nob2xhcmx5IEpvdXJuYWxzmgIHUHJlUGFpZKoCK09TOkVNUy1NZWRpYUxpbmtzU2VydmljZS1nZXRNZWRpYVVybEZvckl0ZW3KAg9BcnRpY2xlfEZlYXR1cmXSAgFZ8gIA%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=5kdD4aA2YrNRQ%2BurKghO7mPWgTc%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=A+Synergic+Use+of+Sentinel-1+and+Sentinel-2+Imagery+for+Complex+Wetland+Classification+Using+Generative+Adversarial+Network+%28GAN%29+Scheme&title=Water&issn=&date=2021-01-01&volume=13&issue=24&spage=3601&au=Jamali%2C+Ali%3BMahdianpari%2C+Masoud%3BMohammadimanesh%2C+Fariba%3BBrisco%2C+Brian%3BSalehi%2C+Bahram&isbn=&jtitle=Water&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fw13243601","Accuracy; Algorithms; Anthropogenic factors; Aquatic ecosystems; Artificial intelligence; Bogs; Canada; Classification; Climate change; CNN; Convolutional neural network; Data collection; Deep Convolutional Neural Network; Deep learning; Environmental Studies; Fens; Generative adversarial network; Generative Adversarial Network; Generative adversarial networks; Global positioning systems--GPS; Imagery; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Methods; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Samples; Shallow water; Swamps; Training; Trends; Wetland; wetland classification; Wetland classification; Wetlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we obtain the latent heat flux (LE) from an EC station and perform gap filling using two deep learning methods (two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks) and two machine learning (ML) models (support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)), and we investigate their accuracies and uncertainties. The average model performance based on ~25 input and hysteresis combinations show that the mean absolute error is in an acceptable range (34.9 to 38.5 Wm−2), which indicates a marginal difference among the performances of the four models. In fact, the model performance is ranked in the following order: SVM > CNN > RF > LSTM. We conduct a robust analysis of variance and post-hoc tests, which yielded statistically insignificant results (p-value ranging from 0.28 to 0.76). This indicates that the distribution of means is equal within groups and among pairs, thereby implying similar performances among the four models. The time-series analysis and Taylor diagram indicate that the improved two-dimensional CNN captures the temporal trend of LE the best, i.e., with a Pearson’s correlation of >0.87 and a normalized standard deviation of ~0.86, which are similar to those of in situ datasets, thereby demonstrating its superiority over other models. The factor elimination analysis reveals that the CNN performs better when specific meteorological factors are removed from the training stage. Additionally, a strong coupling between the hysteresis time factor and the accuracy of the ML models is observed.","2021","2024-01-19 10:22:49","2024-01-19 10:46:05","","4976","","24","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2612846873","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/VGprL?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=7SSkEF7wUBu4JwbbwEovmuq8tHc%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Gap-Filling+Eddy+Covariance+Latent+Heat+Flux%3A+Inter-Comparison+of+Four+Machine+Learning+Model+Predictions+and+Uncertainties+in+Forest+Ecosystem&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2021-01-01&volume=13&issue=24&spage=4976&au=Muhammad+Sarfraz+Khan%3BSeung+Bae+Jeon%3BJeong%2C+Myeong-Hun&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs13244976","Accuracy; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural networks; Carbon; Climate change; CNN; Covariance; Datasets; deep learning; Deep learning; Drought; eddy covariance; Environmental monitoring; error analysis; factor elimination; Fluctuations; flux tower; Forest ecosystems; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Hydrologic cycle; Hydrology; hysteresis; Hysteresis; Investigations; Latent heat; Learning algorithms; Long short-term memory; LSTM; machine learning; Machine learning; Methods; Models; Natural language processing; Neural networks; Physics; Regions; Remote monitoring; Remote sensing; RF; Satellites; Support vector machines; SVM; Terrestrial ecosystems; Time factors; Time series; Uncertainty; United States--US; Variance analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000–2017 (i.e., 15 × 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha−1. The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the RMSE by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. In conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting.","2021","2024-01-19 10:22:49","2024-01-19 10:37:14","","3101","","16","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2565699871","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/FES8M?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=I8QFkpy5lHJ00w0a2NPPfrzwaVY%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Cereal+Yield+Forecasting+with+Satellite+Drought-Based+Indices%2C+Weather+Data+and+Regional+Climate+Indices+Using+Machine+Learning+in+Morocco&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2021-01-01&volume=13&issue=16&spage=3101&au=Bouras%2C+El+houssaine%3BJarlan%2C+Lionel%3BEr-Raki%2C+Salah%3BBalaghi%2C+Riad%3BAmazirh%2C+Abdelhakim%3BBastien%2C+Richard%3BKhabba%2C+Sa%C3%AFd&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs13163101","Agricultural production; Air temperature; Algorithms; Australia; Brazil; Calibration; Cereals; Climate change; climate indices; Climate models; Crop yield; crop yield forecasting; Datasets; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Drought; Drought index; Food security; Forecasting; Growth models; Harvest; Harvesting; Importation; India; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Mathematical models; Meteorological data; Morocco; North Atlantic Oscillation; Physics; Precipitation; Predictions; Rainfall; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; remote sensing drought indices; Satellite observation; Satellites; semiarid region; Soybeans; Statistical analysis; Support vector machines; Variables; Vegetation; Wavelengths; Weather; weather data; Weather forecasting; Wheat; XGBoost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Geospatial Earth Observation (EO) data from remote sensing satellites has been collected continuously for 40 years and has the potential to facilitate the spatio-temporal forecasting of land surface dynamics. In this review we compiled 143 papers on EO-based forecasting of all aspects of the land surface published in 16 high-ranking remote sensing journals within the past decade. We analyzed the literature regarding research focus, the spatial scope of the study, the forecasting method applied, as well as the temporal and technical properties of the input data. We categorized the identified forecasting methods according to their temporal forecasting mechanism and the type of input data. Time-lagged regressions which are predominantly used for crop yield forecasting and approaches based on Markov Chains for future land use and land cover simulation are the most established methods. The use of external climate projections allows the forecasting of numerical land surface parameters up to one hundred years into the future, while auto-regressive time series modeling can account for intra-annual variances. Machine learning methods have been increasingly used in all categories and multivariate modeling that integrates multiple data sources appears to be more popular than univariate auto-regressive modeling despite the availability of continuously expanding time series data. Regardless of the method, reliable EO-based forecasting requires high-level remote sensing data products and the resulting computational demand appears to be the main reason that most forecasts are conducted only on a local scale. In the upcoming years, however, we expect this to change with further advances in the field of machine learning, the publication of new global datasets, and the further establishment of cloud computing for data processing.","2020","2024-01-19 10:22:50","2024-01-19 10:45:45","","3513","","21","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2550319846","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/edUtJ?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=8qvGGq3pJgd1HyO3mti7DYMFtYU%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Forecasting+Spatio-Temporal+Dynamics+on+the+Land+Surface+Using+Earth+Observation+Data%26mdash%3BA+Review&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2020-01-01&volume=12&issue=21&spage=3513&au=Koehler%2C+Jonas%3BKuenzer%2C+Claudia&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs12213513","Autoregressive models; Climate change; Cloud computing; Computer applications; Crop yield; Data processing; Datasets; Earth observation; Earth Observation; Earth observations (from space); Economic forecasting; forecast; Forecasting; Journals; land cover; Land cover; land surface; land use; Land use; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Markov chains; modeling; Physics; Remote observing; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sensors; Surface dynamics; Terrain; time series; Time series; Trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study is to employ a set of machine learning classifiers for detecting invasive plant species using remote sensing data. The target species is Kudzu vine, which mostly grows in the south-eastern states of the US and quickly outcompetes other plants, making it a relevant and threatening species to consider. Our study area is Atlanta, Georgia and the surrounding area. Five different algorithms: Boosted Logistic Regression (BLR), Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were tested with the aim of testing their performance and identifying the most optimal one. Furthermore, the influence of temporal, spectral and spatial resolution in detecting Kudzu was also tested and reviewed. Our finding shows that random forest, neural network and support vector machine classifiers outperformed. While the achieved internal accuracies were about 97%, an external validation conducted over an expanded area of interest resulted in 79.5% accuracy. Furthermore, the study indicates that high accuracy classification can be achieved using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery and can be improved while integrating with airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral data. Finally, this study indicates that dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) should be applied cautiously to the hyperspectral AVIRIS data to preserve its utility. The applied approach and the utilized set of methods can be of interest for detecting other kinds of invasive species as part of fulfilling UN sustainable development goals, particularly number 12: responsible consumption and production, 13: climate action, and 15: life on land.","2020","2024-01-19 10:21:51","2024-01-19 10:43:23","","3544","","9","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2397180322","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/hAMNG?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=72KGwp1pnZ8X4C%2BzWT9bj957q%2Fo%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Employing+Machine+Learning+for+Detection+of+Invasive+Species+using+Sentinel-2+and+AVIRIS+Data%3A+The+Case+of+Kudzu+in+the+United+States&title=Sustainability&issn=&date=2020-01-01&volume=12&issue=9&spage=3544&au=Jensen%2C+Tobias%3BFrederik+Seerup+Hass%3BAkbar%2C+Mohammad+Seam%3BPhilip+Holm+Petersen%3BJamal+Jokar+Arsanjani&isbn=&jtitle=Sustainability&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsu12093544","Accuracy; Algorithms; AVIRIS; Bayesian analysis; classification; Classifiers; Data collection; Environmental Studies; Flowers & plants; hyperspectral imagery; Image classification; Infrared imaging; Infrared spectrometers; Introduced species; Invasive plants; invasive species; Invasive species; Kudzu; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; Native species; Neural networks; Nonnative species; Phenology; Plant species; PLANTS; principal component analysis; Principal components analysis; Regression analysis; REMOTE DETECTION; Remote sensing; sentinel; Sentinel; Sentinel-2; Spatial discrimination; Spatial resolution; Studies; Support vector machines; Sustainable development; United States--US; Vegetation; Weeds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Work to liberate slaves and contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 would benefit from maps showing the location of brick kilns. Previous work has shown that brick kilns can be accurately identified and located visually from fine spatial resolution remote-sensing images. Furthermore, via crowdsourcing, it would be possible to map very large areas. However, concerns over the ability to maintain a motivated crowd to allow accurate mapping over time together with the development of advanced machine learning methods suggest considerable potential for rapid, accurate and repeatable automated mapping of brick kilns. This potential is explored here using fine spatial resolution images of a region of Rajasthan, India. A contemporary deep-learning classifier founded on region-based convolution neural networks (R-CNN), the Faster R-CNN, was trained to classify brick kilns. This approach mapped all of the brick kilns within the study area correctly, with a producer’s accuracy of 100%, but at the cost of substantial over-estimation of kiln numbers. Applying a second classifier to the outputs substantially reduced the over-estimation. This second classifier could be visual classification, which, as it focused on a relatively small number of sites, should be feasible to acquire, or an additional automated classifier. The result of applying a CNN classifier to the outputs of the original classification was a map with an overall accuracy of 94.94% with both low omission and commission error that should help direct anti-slavery activity on the ground. These results indicate that contemporary Earth observation resources and machine learning methods may be successfully applied to help address slavery from space.","2019-01","2024-01-19 10:21:51","2024-01-19 10:43:05","","","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Publicly Available Content Database","2303983726","","","Place: Basel Publisher: MDPI AG","","; ","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/ojhqB?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=ySltmS3OKt0C7kr898IPSyLGe1A%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Earth+Observation+and+Machine+Learning+to+Meet+Sustainable+Development+Goal+8.7%3A+Mapping+Sites+Associated+with+Slavery+from+Space&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2019-01-01&volume=11&issue=3&spage=&au=Foody%2C+Giles+M%3BFeng%2C+Ling%3BBoyd%2C+Doreen+S%3BLi%2C+Xiaodong%3BWardlaw%2C+Jessica&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs11030266","Aquaculture; Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural networks; Cartography; Classification; Classifiers; Construction materials; Convolution; convolutional neural network; crowdsourcing; Deep learning; Earth; Earth observation; Kilns; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; mapping; Mapping; Maps; Neural networks; object-based target detection; Observational learning; Pattern recognition; Physics; Remote sensing; Sensors; slavery; Slavery; Spatial discrimination; Spatial resolution; Sustainable development; United Kingdom--UK; United States--US; Web 2.0; Workforce","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assessment of SDG11.3.1 indicator played an import role in understanding sustainable transitions in urban land use from local to regional and global scales. Based on remote sensing and scenario modeling, this study attempts to develop an approach for monitoring and making projections of the urban land use efficiency indicator to inform urban management and planning. Taking the coastal megacity of Tianjin, China as a case study, the spatial patterns of urban land use change were first mapped using multi-temporal satellite datasets and an urban sprawl matrix method. Then, the urban land use changes for the periods up to 2025 and 2030 under an environmental protection scenario were predicted by integrating local policy constraints into a cellular automata–Markov (CA–Markov) model using analytic hierarchy process and multi-criteria evaluation methods. Finally, values of the urban land use efficiency indicator SDG11.3.1 were derived for the period 2000 to 2030. The results showed that built-up area in Tianjin in 2020 doubled compared with 1990 and that 63.95% of the newly increased built-up land was converted from agricultural lands. The model prediction results indicate that the expansion of built-up land is more concentrated and land consumption and population growth tend to be more closely correlated when constrained by environmental protection measures. Extensive growth of built-up areas predicted in coastal areas might increase ecological and disaster risks, and should be strictly planned. The land use change modeling and analysis framework can be applied to growing coastal cities in other regions to inform sustainable land use planning.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:09","2024-01-19 10:23:09","","106201","","","224","","Ocean & Coastal Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cellular automata–markov model; Coastal zone; Land use efficiency; Megacity; Sustainable development goals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study focuses on Lake Urmia, the world's second-largest hypersaline lake that indicates significant environmental challenges as it approaches near-complete dryness. Over the last decade, new aeolian features, including sand dunes, have emerged due to anthropogenic and natural factors. The present study documents the dynamics of recent aeolian processes on exposed dried-up lakebeds of saline lakes environments by investigating their mineralogy, geochemistry, and sedimentology to understand better dune morphology, evolution and migration rate. Quantitative analyses are performed on the dunes of Lake Urmia's western shores using ancillary data (meteorological and climate), field data, X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-rays Spectroscopy (SEM - EDX), petrographic analysis, and supervised classification and change detection of satellite imagery from 2003 to 2019. The migration rates yielded high values, approximately above 20 m yr−1 on average, mostly related to (1) the rising drift potential (DP), (2) the percentage of wind speeds that are above the threshold velocity (V > Vt%), (3) decline in precipitation and unidirectional wind regime and (4) atmospheric circulations over the Mediterranean Sea. The results infer that local and global-scale factors significantly impact the migration rate of Lake Urmia dunes. The study outcomes are widely applicable to drying up saline lakes worldwide, enhancing the understanding of current aeolian processes and the evolution of dune fields/sand seas, building towards sustainable land management and policy-making.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:09","2024-01-19 10:23:09","","107424","","","232","","CATENA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aeolian processes; Dune morphology; Lake Urmia; Migration rate; Remote sensing; Saline lakes; Sand dunes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Faidherbia albida parklands are widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa and provide several ecosystem services to populations, notably an increase in crop productivity. While remote sensing has been proven useful for crop yield assessment in smallholder farming system, it has so far ignored the woody component. We propose an original approach combining remote sensing, landscape ecology and statistical modelling to i) improve the accuracy of millet yield prediction in parklands and ii) identify the main drivers of millet yield spatial variation. The parkland of Central Senegal was chosen as a case study. Firstly, we calibrated a remote sensing-based linear model that accounted for vegetation productivity and tree density to predict millet yield. Integrating parkland structure improved the accuracy of yield estimation. The best model based on a combination of Green Difference Vegetation Index and number of trees in the field explained 70% of observed yield variability (relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE) of 28%). The best model based solely on vegetation productivity (no information on parkland structure) explained only 46% of the observed variability (RRMSE = 34%). Secondly we investigated the drivers of the spatial variability in estimated yield using Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm (GBM) and biophysical and management factors derived from geospatial data. The GBM model explained 81% of yield spatial variability. Predominant drivers were soil nutrient availability (i.e. soil total nitrogen and total phosphorous) and woody cover in the surrounding landscape of fields. Our results show that millet yield increases with woody cover in the surrounding landscape of fields up to a woody cover of 35%. These findings have to be strengthened by testing the approach in more diversified and/or denser parklands. Our study illustrates that recent advances in earth observations open up new avenues to improve the monitoring of parkland systems in smallholder context.","2020-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:09","2024-01-19 10:23:09","","102918","","","184","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Africa; Agroforestry; Crop yield; Landscape; Remote sensing; Smallholder agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mapping the distribution of oil palm is crucial in order to manage and plan the sustainable operations of oil palm plantations. Remote sensing provides a means to detect and map oil palm from space effectively. Recent advances in cloud computing and big data allow rapid mapping to be performed over large a geographical scale. In this study, 30 m Landsat 8 data were processed using a cloud computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE) in order to classify oil palm land cover using non-parametric machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF) for the first time over Peninsular Malaysia. The hyperparameters were tuned, and the overall accuracy produced by the SVM, CART and RF were 93.16%, 80.08% and 86.50% respectively. Overall, the SVM classified the 7 classes (water, built-up, bare soil, forest, oil palm, other vegetation and paddy) the best. However, RF extracted oil palm information better than the SVM. The algorithms were compared and the McNemar's test showed significant values for comparisons between SVM and CART and RF and CART. On the other hand, the performance of SVM and RF are considered equally effective.

However, geographical and climatic factors have a significant impact on the electrical performance of solar PV modules. In addition, since solar PV energy production models are the only physics-based approach to transferring ground-measured PV energy production to other locations, the authors developed 294 physical models from six different PV power technologies and validated them for the model's adaptability. To facilitate the possible determination of PV electric energy generation in the unique geographical and climatic environment of the experiment site, these models were built using machine learning, Gumbel's probabilistic approach (GPM), and hybridization of the two. The major challenges in this study are in developing the hybridized machine learning with the Gumbel probabilistic functional model, which resides in the mathematical transformation process, which required a great deal of repeated mathematical science knowledge to arrive at the final transformed and efficient model for predicting the potential of solar PV output. With a thorough coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9998% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0063 kwh, the hybrid model with only the measurable solar radiation parameter is the closest to the measured PV energy production of all technologies. The best hybridized model was used to explore the potential impacts of climate change on the different solar PV technologies. This was achieved by using energy parameters from the Australian Community Climate and Global System Simulation (ACCESS-CM2) in Phase 6. On an annual basis, the effects of climate change on various PV technologies have had a small adverse impact (less than 1%) on these renewable energy technologies. It was also found that, compared to other technologies, CIGS thin film technology produced the least negative effects on climate change, with 10.94%–36.75% in the best-case, 35.71%–36.36% in the moderate-case, and 33.33–40.00% in the worst-case scenario for shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585) emissions. This suggests the intrinsic properties of Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) thin film modules are more effective at withstanding high temperatures as they contribute 60.00–89.66% of their intrinsic module properties to PV energy production compared to other technologies. However, taking into account the time, resource availability, cost-effectiveness, commercialization, and consumption of various PV technologies studied in this era of global sustainability, poly-crystalline (p-Si) technology is highly recommended for harvesting solar PV energy products in Alice Springs, Australia.","2023-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:09","2024-01-19 10:23:09","","103389","","","130","","Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; CMIP6; Global warming; Module intrinsic features; Solar photovoltaic power","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes a method that reduces the time and cost of creating land use maps applicable for many purposes of environmental protection. Freely accessible existing data, Sentinel-2 satellite images, together with a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, are integrated to generate an annual map, sufficient to meet the intended needs. The method is illustrated by a case study of Phuket in Thailand. An annual map for Phuket created using the proposed method was compared to the official map released by the Thai government for the year 2018. The two maps did not differ significantly, validating the efficacy of the proposed method. Annual maps were then produced for several years to assess the effect of land use change in the past 19 years on the environmental and sustainable management in Phuket. Although there was evidence of the efforts to develop Phuket island as a sustainable province such as the government policy to conserve green areas, land use change based analytical results indicated Phuket's urban development was not going in an environmentally sustainable direction.","2021-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:09","2024-01-19 10:23:09","","1239-1254","","","27","","Sustainable Production and Consumption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bio-capacity; Green map; Greenhouse gasses; Indicators; Land use change; Sustainable city","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of urban greening initiatives of cities worldwide aimed at mitigating these issues. However, ET estimation methods in urban areas have so far been limited. An expanding number of flux towers in urban environments provide the opportunity to directly measure ET by the eddy covariance method. In this study, we present a novel approach to model urban ET by combining flux footprint modeling, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) data, and deep learning and machine learning techniques. This approach facilitates spatio-temporal extrapolation of ET at a half-hourly resolution; we tested this approach with a two-year dataset from two flux towers in Berlin, Germany. The benefit of integrating remote sensing and GIS data into models was investigated by testing four predictor scenarios. Two algorithms (1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and random forest (RF)) were compared. The best-performing models were then used to model ET values for the year 2019. The inclusion of GIS data extracted using flux footprints enhanced the predictive accuracy of models, particularly when meteorological data was more limited. The best-performing scenario (meteorological and GIS data) showed an RMSE of 0.0239 mm/h and R2 of 0.840 with RF and an RMSE of 0.0250 mm/h and a R2 of 0.824 with 1D CNN for the more vegetated site. The 2019 ET sum was substantially higher at the site surrounded by more urban greenery (366 mm) than at the inner-city site (223 mm), demonstrating the substantial influence of vegetation on the urban water cycle. The proposed method is highly promising for modeling ET in a heterogeneous urban environment and can support climate change mitigation initiatives of urban areas worldwide.","2021-09-10","2024-01-19 10:23:10","2024-01-19 10:23:10","","147293","","","786","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1D convolutional neural networks (CNN); Deep learning; Eddy covariance; Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2; Latent heat flux; Urban water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an approach to distinguish residential settlement types (regular vs. irregular) using an existing database of settlement points locating structures. Nine data features describing the density, distance, angles, and spacing of the settlement points are calculated at multiple spatial scales. These data are analysed alone and with five common remote sensing measures on elevation, slope, vegetation, and nighttime lights in a supervised machine learning approach to classify land use areas. The method was tested in seven provinces of Afghanistan (Balkh, Helmand, Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, Kunduz, Nangarhar). Overall accuracy ranged from 78% in Kandahar to 90% in Nangarhar.

Particularly, in China, the number and scale of photovoltaic (PV) power stations have grown unprecedentedly in the last decade. There is an urgent need to monitor the PV power development in order to accurately estimate national renewable potentials and understand the ecological impacts. However, there are few efforts towards providing spatially explicit and time-series datasets of PV development at the regional and national scales. To fill the gap, this study proposes an integrated remote sensing approach for PV power stations mapping by combining image segmentation and object-based classification (ISOC) techniques. We took five northwestern provinces of China as an illustration and produced 30-m medium-resolution PV power station distribution maps from 2007 to 2019. Our analysis shows that the total area of PV power stations in the five provinces increased to 722 km 2 in 2019, with producer, user and overall accuracies of 86%, 100% and 93%. Of the 309 PV station clusters (hereafter, PV parks), the top 7% largest ones account for 61% of the total area of PV power stations, indicating that PV power stations in the Northwest tend to be developed in the form of large-scale centralized PV parks. The land used for PV power stations was mainly converted from four land cover types: Gobi Desert, sandy land, sparse grassland, and moderate grassland. The central government policy on facilitating clean energy played a major role in driving the rapid expansion of PV parks across the country. The methodology and results of this study will help policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to develop corresponding industrial standards and environmental regulations to mitigate the potential environmental impacts, and promote more sustainable development of solar energy in China and beyond.","2022-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:12","2024-01-19 10:23:12","","4117-4127","","","8","","Energy Reports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon neutrality; Climate actions; Landsat; Object-based classification; Renewable energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis demonstrates that it is possible to predict sorghum yields with attenuated non-classical measurement error, resulting in a less-biased assessment of the relationship between yields and agricultural inputs. The external validity of the findings based on the data from a sub-national survey experiment is verified using the data from a nationally representative agricultural survey.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Cellular Automata (CA) model is use to predict the LULC, while the XGB Regression model is used to predict seasonal LST with input data from 2010, 2015, and 2020 to predict future scenarios of 2025 and 2030.

This research focuses on Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) states in central India, where forest fire risk has become particularly pronounced. The primary objectives of the study are to quantify and map the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest fires over the period 2001 to 2020, and to predict future fire risks using satellite derived datasets and machine learning techniques. Through a long-term analysis, the study revealed an alarming increase in the number of forest fire incidents in MP and CG. From an average of 1200 and 1000 during 2001 to 2005, the incidents increased to 2800 and 2100 during 2016 to 2020, in MP and CG respectively. To predict forest fire risk, Random Forest machine learning algorithm was adopted utilizing various satellite derived climatic, topographical, and ecological parameters such as temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, NDVI, soil moisture, litter availability, evapotranspiration and terrain parameters (at monthly scale for 20 years). While forecasting fire probability for 2018–2020, the model achieves high accuracy rate of 86.46 % in MP and 93.78 % in CG. The results highlight significant forest fire likelihood regions in the central MP and the Southern CG, identifying areas requiring enhanced fire management strategies. This study has revealed that NDVI and rainfall have played a positive role in restricting the forest fire, and their negative anomaly amplified the fire risk. The study would help forest planners and administrators to characterise vulnerable areas and prioritise their conservation provisions.","2023-12-28","2024-01-19 10:23:12","2024-01-19 10:23:12","","","","","","","Advances in Space Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","- Random Forest Regression; Central India; Ensemble machine learning; Forest Fire; MODIS active fire data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurately and effectively identifying and evaluating poverty has become an important prerequisite for allowing Chinese governments to make reasonable poverty reduction and alleviation policies. Thus, using Chongqing as a study area, the purpose of this study was to analyze poverty from multiple viewpoints based on multiple data sources. First, a comprehensive poverty index (CPI) was developed by combining nighttime light data, the digital elevation model (DEM), the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and point of interest (POI) data to map poverty at a 500-m spatial resolution. Then, the performance of the CPI was validated with poverty-stricken villages, Google Earth images, and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI). Finally, spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to explore the spatial distribution of poverty across county and town levels. The results revealed that the CPI could provide an effective way of identifying the spatial distribution of poverty when compared with three validated indexes. Most of the rich counties were in the center of Chongqing, whereas the poor counties were located in the northeast and southeast of Chongqing. The Global Moran’s I index showed that there were significantly positive spatial autocorrelations of poverty, and that the spatial autocorrelation of poverty was more significant at the town level compared to the county level. Among the selected factors, the POI cost distance was the most import factor for assessing poverty. Our study will be valuable for providing scientific references for the government to implement precise poverty alleviation methods with differentiated policies in China.","2020-05-10","2024-01-19 10:23:12","2024-01-19 10:23:12","","120245","","","255","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chongqing; Multiscale analysis; Nighttime light data; POI; Poverty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Composite drought indices have been considered a useful tool to capture the compound drought impacts, however, few of them are capable of operating at multi-timescales. Moreover, the vast of composite drought indices fail to depict the whole water deficit on terrestrial because of the ignoring of groundwater. In this study, we linearly combined two satellite observed variables, TWS (Terrestrial Water Storage) and VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit), to develop a new index WDDI (Water Deficit Drought Index). It can provide the global composite drought conditions at multi-timescales by different weight combinations. The global multiscalar SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) from 2002 to 2011 and 2012 to 2017 were selected to train and assess the weights respectively. Weights assessment results showed that SPEI and WDDI reached moderate correlations (r > 0.4) over the globe, especially stronger in the summer season (0.5 < r < 0.88). Good agreements between WDDI and scPDSI (self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index), SPEI were found in the global historical drought area statistics, especially in area statistics of severe or worse drought conditions. WDDI at short and long timescales were found to be sensitive to drought signals in the meteorological and hydrological system respectively as it produced moderate or stronger correlations with VsmCI (Volumetric soil moisture Condition Index) and RCI (Runoff Condition Index) in most parts of the world. The application of WDDI in the specific drought events (the 2010 Russian drought and the 2012–2016 California drought) further reinforced the above inferences and revealed the unique superiority of considering groundwater deficit in hydrological drought monitoring. The new proposed multiscalar WDDI could help practitioners better identify the drought conditions and understand the drought propagation mechanism from the meteorological to the hydrological system.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:13","2024-01-19 10:23:13","","128622","","","615","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Drought Indicator; Drought Monitoring; Terrestrial Water Storage; Vapor Pressure Deficit; Water Deficit Drought Index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the lack of data has made it difficult to evaluate the success of reaching these goals. To address this, a method is proposed in this paper to generate temporal building height maps and extract features from the 3D structure of urban areas to examine their relationship with environmental variables, acquired from remote sensing satellites. Therefore, no survey data is required from the study area. Building height map is generated by processing Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Nighttime light data by a UNet-based deep model. The results showed significant improvements in Mean Square Errors compared to available building maps in Berlin and London. In the second step, several features were extracted from the 3D structure of urban areas, and their relationship with environmental variables such as atmosphere contents from Sentinel-5 data and Urban Heat Island (UHI) from MODIS was examined via shallow regression models. The spatial study shows high correlation between each environmental variable and height map features in a neighborhood, with R2 scores of 0.78, 0.94, 0.92, 0.7, and 0.88 for CO2, CO, NO2, SO2, and UHI, respectively. It is found the environmental parameters are shaped by the collective building heights within a specific neighborhood, rather than hinging on the individual building heights at the sampling site. Furthermore, spatial resolution plays a significant role. In the case of the MODIS-based heat island map, a 3 km neighborhood yields a high R2-score, whereas when utilizing Sentinel-5 data, it is advisable to employ a larger neighborhood. Furthermore, the temporal study shows even higher R2 scores than the spatial domain, indicating the temporal reliability of the proposed method. The findings of this study can be used by governors and decision makers for sustainable urban development.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:13","2024-01-19 10:23:13","","101736","","","52","","Urban Climate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Neighborhood information; Sentinel-5; Temporal building height; Urban heat island","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under climate change, droughts become severe due to the lack of precipitation, and food insecurity exists in many developing countries. Indonesia has been facing the challenges of climate change, especially in mitigating the effects of drought, and it is essential to select land that is suitable for micro-level crop production. Therefore, the aim of this research was to classify the suitable lands in drought-prone areas of central East Java of Indonesia. GIS and satellite remote sensing datasets have been used to develop a land suitability analysis based on the FAO classification. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was incorporated with expert opinion using factors and constraints, which influenced the land suitability assessments. The integrated AHP and the land suitability analysis inferred that 40.26 per cent of the study area was classified as highly suitable, 30.82 per cent were moderately suitable, and 21.89 per cent were marginally suitable for Maize Cultivation in central East Java. At the microlevel, the suitable land were further divided using a random forest classifier with high-dimensional classification features to increase the computational efficiency using k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithms. The experimental results of this algorithm could effectively search the nearest classifier to increase the algorithm efficiency. This research recommends extending the machine learning approach with remote sensing and GIS to select suitable land for maize production at the microlevels in drought-prone areas.","2020-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:13","2024-01-19 10:23:13","","100421","","","20","","Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Classification; Drought; GIS; Land suitability analysis; Microlevels; Random forest; Remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives We apply a spatial modelling approach to identify census enumeration areas (EAs) in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) of Ghana with a high probability of being a deprived area using publicly available census and remote sensing data. Methods We obtained United Nations (UN) supported field mapping data that identified deprived “slum” areas in Accra’s urban core, data on housing and population conditions from the most recent census, and remotely sensed data on environmental conditions in the GAMA. We first fitted a Bayesian logistic regression model on the data in Accra’s urban core (n=2,414 EAs) that estimated the relationship between housing, population, and environmental predictors and being a deprived area according to the UN’s deprived area assessment. Using these relationships, we predicted the probability of being a deprived area for each of the 4,615 urban EAs in GAMA. Results 899 (19%) of the 4,615 urban EAs in GAMA, with an estimated 745,714 residents (22% of its urban population), had a high predicted probability (>80%) of being a deprived area. These deprived EAs were dispersed across GAMA and relatively heterogeneous in their housing and environmental conditions, but shared some common features including a higher population density, lower elevation and vegetation abundance, and less access to indoor piped water and sanitation. Conclusion Our approach using ubiquitously available administrative and satellite data can be used to identify deprived neighbourhoods where interventions are warranted to improve living conditions, and track progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals aiming to reduce the population living in unsafe or vulnerable human settlements.","2023-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:13","2024-01-19 10:23:13","","106253","","","167","","World Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Informal settlements; Satellite imagery; Urban poverty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Northwest China, soil salinity is a problem affecting the Lake Ebinur area and needs to be monitored and addressed. The use of optical remote sensing technology to for timely and accurate soil salinity monitoring has great potentials and can be crucial for industrial and agricultural development. Optical remote sensing technology is an important data source for monitoring of soil salinization because of its rich spectral information and high-resolution. Based on the HJ-1/HSI data of fractional derivative transformation, this paper calculated the parameters, such as the difference index (DI), normalized difference index (NDI), ratio index (RI) and salt index (SI), that can invert the spatial distribution of salinization and then calculates a particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSO-SVM). These index parameters were used to invert the spatial distribution information of salinized soil to explore the influence of fractional derivatives on the estimation accuracy of the spatial distribution of salinized soil. The results showed the following: (1) The optimal model based on different fractional derivatives and exponential transformations was the DI transformation under the fractional derivative of 1.2-order. R2, RMSE and RPD were 0.66, 13.81 g/kg and 2.59, respectively. These data show that the model had a good prediction effect. (2) The application of fractional derivatives in the processing of hyperspectral images could highlight the spectral details of the images and enrich their pretreatment methods, which is of great significance for the inversion of the distribution of salinized soil by hyperspectral images. (3) In the lakeside area of Lake Ebinur, the soil is mainly saline to severely saline. In the northern mountainous region of Lake Ebinur, the soil is mainly non-saline soil to mildly saline soil. Finally, in the Kuitun riverbank area in the southeast of Lake Ebinur, the soils are mainly non-saline soils to mildly saline soils. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of spectral index optimization and prediction models to monitor soil salinization based on fractional derivatives. This technique highlights the spectral detail information and enriches the preprocessing methods of hyperspectral imagery, resulting in the mapping of the spatial distribution of the degree of soil salinization. This has practical importance for the prevention and control of soil salinization and its spatial extent in arid and semi-arid regions.","2020-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:13","2024-01-19 10:23:13","","106869","","","119","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fractional derivative; Hyperspectral index; Particle swarm optimization; Remote sensing; Soil salt content; Support vector machine (SVM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) may have profound implications for the sustainable development of the involved countries.

In this paper, we addressed this gap by analysing the progress towards SDGs during 2000–2019 on both the BRI and national scales by accounting for the social, economic, and environmental SDGs. We found that the BRI SDG index (SDGI), calculated by summing up the results from the three dimensions, increased from 43.5 in 2000 to 60.2 in 2019. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the BRI nations were at least halfway towards reaching the best performance of SDGs as of 2019. Of the 65 BRI nations, European countries generally performed better, while Central and West Asian countries performed relatively poorly according to the SDGI. Overall, the BRI showed high, medium, and low scores in achieving the economic, social, and environmental SDGs, respectively. In addition, the three dimensions have shown significant synergistic relationships over the past 20 years, although the synergies are weakening. Our research described the progress of BRI towards the SDGs, revealing that more attention should be paid to the environmental dimension, particularly to SDG 15 (life on land), as it received the lowest score and had the steepest downward trend of all SDGs. Considering the spatial heterogeneity among the BRI nations, we proposed a geospatial division and management plan as a potential measure to achieve SDGs.","2023-10-20","2024-01-19 10:23:13","2024-01-19 10:23:13","","138808","","","424","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Belt and Road Initiative (BRI); Geospatial division and management; SDG index (SDGI); Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study aimed at retrieving and mapping water quality parameters (WQPs) of Owabi Dam reservoir from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat 8 (L8) satellite data, using random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. Water samples from 45 systematic plots were analysed for pH, turbidity, alkalinity, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen. The performances of all three models were compared in terms of adjusted coefficient of determination (R2.adj), and the root mean square error (RMSE) using repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure. To determine the status of water quality, pixel-level predictions were used to compute model-assisted estimates of WQPs and compared with reference values from the World Health Organization. Generally, all three models produced more accurate results for S2 compared to L8. On average, the inter-sensor relative efficiency showed that S2 outperformed L8 by 67% in retrieving WQPs of the Owabi Dam reservoir. S2 gave the highest accuracy for RF (R2.adj = 95–99%, RMSE = 0.02–3.03) and least for MLR (R2.adj = 55–91%, RMSE = 0.03–3.14).

While area under forest cover can provide useful information regarding discrete changes in forest cover, it does not provide any insight on subtle changes within the broad vegetation class, e.g. forest degradation. Continental or national-level studies, mostly utilizing coarse-scale satellite data, are likely to fail in capturing these changes due to the fine spatial and long temporal characteristics of forest degradation. Yet, these long-term changes affect forest structure, composition and function, thus ultimately limiting successful implementation of SDG targets. Using a multi-scale, satellite-based monitoring approach, our goal is to provide an easy-to-implement reporting framework for South Asian forest ecosystems. We systematically analyze freely available remote sensing assets on Google Earth Engine for monitoring degradation and evaluate the potential of multiple satellite data with different spatial resolutions for reporting forest degradation. Taking a broad-brush approach in step 1, we calculate vegetation trends in six south Asian countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during 2000–2016. We also calculate rainfall trends in these countries using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) rainfall data, and further calculate Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE) that shows vegetation trends in the context of rainfall variability. In step 2, we focus on two protected area test cases from India and Sri Lanka for evaluating the potential of finer-resolution satellite data compared to MODIS, i.e. Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data, for capturing forest degradation signals, which will ultimately contribute towards SDG indicators 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. We find that most countries show a fluctuating trend in vegetation condition over the years, along with localized greening and browning. The Random Forest (RF) classifier utilized in step 2 was able to generate accurate maps (87% and 91% overall accuracy for Indian and Sri Lankan test cases, respectively) of non-intact forest within the protected areas. We find that almost one-third of the Indian test case is degraded forest, even though it shows overall greening as per the broad-brush approach. This finding corroborates our argument that utilizing higher-resolution satellite data (e.g. 10-m) than those normally used for national-level studies will be crucial for reporting SDG indicator 15.2.1: “progress towards sustainable forest management”.","2020-02-01","2024-01-19 10:23:13","2024-01-19 10:23:13","","111592","","","237","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Asia; CHIRPS; Climate; Forest degradation; Google Earth Engine; Landsat; MODIS; Protected area; Rain-Use Efficiency; SDG indicator; Sentinel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research was conducted in the south-western coastal zone of Bangladesh, where rice is the main crop and other crops are also grown. Land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing techniques such as the use of satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can forecast the crop yield and can also provide information on weeds, nutrient deficiencies, diseases, etc. to monitor and treat the crops. Depending on the reflectance received by sensors, remotely sensed images store a digital number (DN) for each pixel. Traditionally, these pixel values have been used to separate clusters and classify various objects. However, it frequently generates a lot of discontinuity in a particular land cover, resulting in small objects within a land cover that provide poor image classification output. It is called the salt-and-pepper effect. In order to classify land cover based on texture, shape, and neighbors, Pixel-Based Image Analysis (PBIA) and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) methods use digital image classification algorithms like Maximum Likelihood (ML), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), k-means clustering algorithm, etc. to smooth this discontinuity. The authors evaluated the accuracy of both the PBIA and OBIA approaches by classifying the land cover of an agricultural field, taking into consideration the development of UAV technology and enhanced image resolution. For classifying multispectral UAV images, we used the KNN machine learning algorithm for object-based supervised image classification and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classification (parametric) for pixel-based supervised image classification. Whereas, for unsupervised classification using pixels, we used the K-means clustering technique. For image analysis, Near-infrared (NIR), Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B) bands of a high-resolution ground sampling distance (GSD) 0.0125m UAV image was used in this research work. The study found that OBIA was 21% more accurate than PBIA, indicating 94.9% overall accuracy. In terms of Kappa statistics, OBIA was 27% more accurate than PBIA, indicating Kappa statistics accuracy of 93.4%.

In this context, we aimed to perform a digital mapping of soil AWC and interpret the results of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and, in a case study, to show that digital AWC maps can support agricultural planning in response to the local effects of climate change. To do so, we divided this research into two approaches: In the first approach, we showed a DSM using 1857 sample points in a southeastern region of Brazil with laboratory-determined soil attributes, together with a pedotransfer function (PTF), remote sensing and DSM techniques. In the second approach, the constructed AWC digital soil map and weather station data were used to calculate climatological soil water balances for the periods between 1917–1946 and 1991–2020. The result showed the selection of covariates using Shapley values as a criterion contributed to the parsimony of the model, obtaining goodness-of-fit metrics of R2 0.72, RMSE 16.72 mm m−1, CCC 0.83, and Bias of 0.53 over the validation set.

The interaction between natural resources and ICT has a positive impact on CO2 in the.05-0.25,0.85-1.45, and 14.7–17.45 ranges, but a negative impact in the.35-0.65 and 5.65–8.45 ranges. Urbanization, energy use, and economic complexity play the biggest roles in Asian CO2 predictions. The findings suggest that governments in Asian countries should prioritize sustainable management of natural resources through the utilization of information and communication technology (ICT) resources. Additionally, the article recommends increasing trade integration and cooperation with other Asian countries in the ICT industry and investing in smart urbanization to improve environmental quality. To address energy sustainability, the research suggests prioritizing energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy sources to achieve the goals of SDG7 and SDG13.","2023-05-01","2024-01-19 10:23:13","2024-01-19 10:23:13","","103548","","","82","","Resources Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Asia; Digitalization; Environmental sustainability; Machine learning; Natural resource","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these vegetation TS from remote sensing (i.e. normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and climatic data (standardized precipitation index (SPI)) are generally non-stationary in the real world. For this reason, traditional TS forecasting algorithms are incapable of extracting sufficient sequence data features, resulting in poor forecasting accuracy. In this paper, a novel parallel hybrid forecasting framework (Veg-W2TCN) is proposed combining multi-resolution analysis wavelet transform (MRA-WT) and temporal convolution network (TCN) model for vegetation change forecasting. In the first step, the NDVI and SPI TSs are divided into multiple groups using land cover information. For effective feature extraction, each group of data is decomposed using MRA-WT into trend and seasonal. Then, the obtained trend/seasonal from NDVI and SPI are concatenated. Multivariate TSs are obtained for each land cover. Then, each component is trained individually using the TCN model. In this step, the grid search algorithm is exploited to select the optimal TCN hyperparameters. Finally, a sum is used to integrate the different results. The proposed method is tested in the Mediterranean area. Veg-W2TCN proved its effectiveness for non-stationary TS forecasting. In fact, around 83% of pixels have a RMSE lower than 0,1 using Veg-W2TCN, compared to 74%, 72%, 60% and 59% of pixels are presented in TCN, long short-term memory (LSTM), multiple linear regression (MLR) and gated recurrent unit (GRU).","2023-04-01","2024-01-19 10:23:13","2024-01-19 10:23:13","","110172","","","137","","Applied Soft Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deep learning; Hybrid forecasting method; Multiple models; Time series forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is a challenge to automate in-season crop type mapping over a large area because of the insufficiency of ground truth and issues of scalability, reusability, and accessibility of the classification model. This study introduces a framework for automatic crop type mapping using spatiotemporal crop information and Sentinel-2 data based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). The main advantage of the framework is using the trusted pixels extracted from the historical Cropland Data Layer (CDL) to replace ground truth and label training samples in satellite images. OBJECTIVE This paper will achieve three objectives: (1) assessing spatiotemporal crop information derived from the historical crop cover maps; (2) mapping crop cover, mainly crop fields without regular historical crop rotation patterns, from remote sensing data using supervised learning classification and validating mapping results; and (3) automating in-season crop mapping and exploring the scalability of the framework. METHODS The proposed crop mapping workflow consists of four stages. The data preparation stage preprocesses CDL and Sentinel-2 data into the required structure. The spatiotemporal crop information sampling stage extracts trusted pixels from the historical CDL time series and labels Sentinel-2 data. Then a crop type classification model can be trained using the supervised learning classifier in the model training stage. In the mapping/validation stage, an in-season crop cover map over the full Sentinel-2 tile will be produced using the trained model and the classification performance will be validated using CDL or other ground truth data. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS We systematically perform a group of experiments for in-season mapping of five major crop types (corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and soybeans-wheat double cropping) over the Mississippi Delta region. The result indicates that the crop cover map of the study area is expected to reach 80%–90% agreement with CDL within the growing season. To further facilitate the use of the framework, we also develop a GEE-enabled online prototype, In-season Crop Mapping Kit, and explore its scalability over agricultural fields in various ecoregions including California, Idaho, Kansas, and Illinois. SIGNIFICANCE The mapping-without-ground-truth approach described in this paper can significantly reduce ground truthing process and save substantial resource needs and labor costs, which is applicable to the production of in-season CDL-like data for the entire United States. The findings and outputs will benefit the agriculture community and other agricultural sectors ranging from government, academia, and companies.","2022-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:15","2024-01-19 10:23:15","","103462","","","201","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agriculture 4.0; Crop mapping; Cropland Data Layer; Google Earth Engine; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our findings revealed that MAP was the most important environmental variable in estimating biodiversity, followed by slope, aspect, and elevation. Next, the ability of four ML algorithms (multiple linear regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine) and a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate biodiversity was evaluated by the coefficient of determination (r-square) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) metrics. The DNN model achieved the highest accuracy (r-square: 0.884) among the ML algorithms and was further optimized to determine the optimal level of model complexity. These findings highlight the potential of DNN to effectively estimate biodiversity and suggest that using EF features with DL algorithms can improve our understanding of the relationships between environmental drivers and biodiversity, providing valuable insights for conservation and management decision-making towards sustainable development.","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:15","2024-01-19 10:23:15","","102319","","","78","","Ecological Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Alpha diversity; Biodiversity; Deep neural networks; Ecological management; Environmental factors; Machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To find research clusters, trends, and themes linked to SDGs and their connection to environmental sustainability, we thoroughly analyzed 29,897 publications from 2012 to 2022. The analysis showed that SDG 15, SDG 7, SDG 12, SDG 13, and SDG 11 were the top five SDGs, with an environmental focus among the 17 SDGs. These top SDGs had many clusters connected to them, illustrating various sustainability-related problems. The study also looked at connections between SDGs, the nations with the highest rates of productivity, the top contributors, and the journals with the highest citation counts. We discovered three separate SDG clusters using co-occurrence network analysis, each representing a different SDG. We discovered relevant SDGs using Matrice d'impacts croisés multiplication appliquée á un classment (MICMAC) analysis and centrality indicators like eigenvector and betweenness. This novel method for publishing analysis combines an AHP focus that aligns with the SDGs with social network analysis and centrality metrics.

Data-driven machine learning techniques (including Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)) and a knowledge-based approach (AHP) are used in this study to pinpoint areas of Chittagong that are particularly susceptible to soil erosion while taking into account 18 soil erosion-regulating parameters. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the selected data-driven machine learning models and knowledge-based models was assessed by utilizing soil erosion and non-erosion sites. When evaluating the fidelity of each model using the ROC and AUC, the RF model was shown to be the most accurate and predictive. There is no poor performer among these models; all have AUCs greater than 67 % (RF = 0.86, ANN = 0.73, SVM = 0.67, CART = 0.67, and AHP = 0.82).

The best models' results after comparing models of data-driven and knowledge-based approaches can help to estimate soil erosion risk zones and provide insight into establishing appropriate policies to minimize this issue. In addition, the methods used in this research might be applicable to assessing the vulnerability and risk of soil erosion events in other areas.

With the development of remote sensing data and prediction models, the comprehensive utilization of multisource remote sensing data based on a fusion approach and testing its effectiveness in SOC content prediction is an interesting and challenging topic. However, there is no evidence showing the role of different data sources in the SOC content prediction process. In this study, a total of 796 topsoil samples (0–20 cm) were collected at Site 1, and 111 samples were collected at Site 2. The samples from Site 2 were used to verify the transferability of the prediction model established at Site 1. The discrete wavelet transform based on the regional energy weight (RW-DWT) and spectral band segmentation methods were used to fuse the temporal information of 10 scenes of Landsat multispectral image data from 2009 to 2019, the spatial information of topography data and the spectral information of GaoFen-5 hyperspectral images. Then, the SOC content prediction models were established by temporal-spatial-spectral (TSS) information using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. The results indicated that the optimal SOC content prediction model consisted of TSS information as input and the CNN as the prediction model, where the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) was 2.49 g kg−1, the highest coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.86 and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) was 1.91. Next, the order of the effect was spectral > temporal > spatial information in terms of SOC content prediction, and their roles in improving the accuracy of the model were 26.79%, 19.64% and 14.29%, respectively, with the CNN model. In addition, the CNN yielded a higher prediction accuracy than PLSR and RF regardless of which group of input variables was used. The average RMSE of the CNN was 0.42 g kg −1 lower than that of the RF, and the average R2 and RPIQ were 9.25% and 0.14 higher, respectively, than those of the RF. The above conclusions were confirmed in the verification area, namely, the optimal SOC content prediction model at Site 2 consisted of TSS information as input and the CNN as the prediction model (RMSE = 1.01 g kg −1, R2 = 0.76 and RPIQ = 1.41). Therefore, the novel method proposed in this study is robust.

Over the past years, the use of hyperspectral (HS) sensors has rapidly increased to improve the reliability and efficiency of core logging. However, scanning drill-core samples of an entire mineral deposit entails several complex challenges, from transport logistics to large scale data management and analysis. Hence, academic studies on new applications of drill-core HS data at a mineral deposit scale remain rare. We present a semi-automated workflow for large scale interpretation of HS data, founded on a novel approach of mineral mapping based on a supervised dictionary learning technique. This approach exploits the complementary information from scanning electron microscopy based automated mineralogy and hyperspectral imaging techniques for estimating mineral quantities along all boreholes. We propose that it is effectively possible to propagate the mineral quantification to the entire borehole from small samples with high resolution mineralogical information strategically selected throughout the deposit. We showcase this approach on data acquired in the Elvira shale-hosted volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposit located at the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), where 7000 m of drill-core were acquired along 80 boreholes. Resulting maps provide insights on the controls on the mineral assemblages and chemical composition of specific minerals across the whole volume at several spatial scales, from large scale variations within apparently homogeneous black shales to small scale mineral composition variations, of potential use as vectors towards mineralization. This approach adds value to the core data, allowing for a better understanding of the geological setting of the Elvira deposit and providing valuable insights for future exploration targeting in the region. This approach based on machine learning can easily be transposed to different ore deposits with a limited input from a geologist.","2021-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:16","2024-01-19 10:23:16","","104514","","","139","","Ore Geology Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3D modelling; Dictionary learning; Drill-cores; Hyperspectral data; Machine learning; Mineral quantification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we have developed forty-nine Novel Earth Observation Variables (NEOVs) from MODIS products, an asset to the present investigation. To determine the effectiveness and ecological significance of NEOVs combinations, we built and compared four different models, namely, a bioclimatic model (BCM) with bioclimatic predictor variables, a phenology model (PhenoM) with earth observation derived phenological predictor variables, a biophysical model (BiophyM) with earth observation derived biophysical predictor variables, and a hybrid model (HM) with a combination of selected predictor variables from BCM, PhenoM, and BiophyM. All models utilized topographical variables by default. Models that include NEOVs were competitive for focal species, and models without NEOVs had considerably poor model performance and explanatory strength. To ascertain the accurate predictions, we assessed the congruence of predictions by pairwise comparisons of their performance. Among the three machine learning algorithms tested (artificial neural networks, generalised boosting model, and maximum entropy), maximum entropy produced the most promising predictions for BCM, PhenoM, BiophyM, and HM. Area under curve (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS) scores for the BCM, PhenoM, BiophyM, and HM models derived from maximum entropy were AUC ≥0.9 and TSS ≥0.6 for the focal species. The overall investigation revealed the competency of NEOVs in the accurate prediction of species' fundamental niches, but conventional bioclimatic variables were unable to achieve such a level of precision. A principal component analysis of environmental spaces disclosed that niches of focal species substantially overlapped each other.

Accurately identifying and mapping irrigated and rainfed croplands can hasten the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2, aimed at reducing poverty and hunger, respectively. However, traditional methods employed to identify and map cropland areas are expensive and require substantial labour, particularly in extensive environments. As a result, this study presents a comprehensive and spatially explicit methodological framework for identifying and mapping national-scale irrigated and rainfed croplands in South Africa. This framework leverages low-cost earth observation technologies (Sentinel-2 MSI) and employs highly accurate classification algorithms, namely Deep Learning Neural Network (DNN) and Random Forest (RF). The proposed methodology strategically integrates data from multiple sources, including public repositories (e.g., cropland data, evapotranspiration), ongoing research (e.g., land cover maps), and field data, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the results. The methodology begins by employing a robust random forest model to classify the study area into distinct land cover types. Leveraging the power of a deep learning neural network (DNN), the method accurately distinguishes between irrigated and rainfed croplands in South Africa. The random forest model achieved a notable classification accuracy of 0.77 when identifying the main land-use and land cover types. Meanwhile, the deep learning neural network (DNN) model achieved an accuracy of 0.71 in differentiating rainfed and irrigated croplands at a national scale. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in providing baseline information relevant to crop monitoring, yield forecasting, and understanding agricultural food supply systems. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has the potential to offer timely and accurate information on cropland areas and their extent which could assist in implementing targeted interventions for optimising agricultural productivity. With its potential to be upscaled to other sub-Saharan countries, this methodology enriches agricultural decision-making and plays a vital role in bolstering food security and advancing the attainment of SDGs.","2023-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:16","2024-01-19 10:45:35","","117-130","","","204","","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cropland areas; DEEP learning; Earth observation; FARM supplies; FARMS; FOOD supply; Large scale; MACHINE learning; National scale mapping; RANDOM forest algorithms; South Africa; SOUTH Africa; Wall-to-wall mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are responsible for substantial damages and losses in those areas. The A1 Highway, which is an important road in Algeria, was sometimes constructed in mountainous and/or semi-mountainous areas. Previous studies of landslide susceptibility mapping conducted near this road using statistical and expert methods have yielded ordinary results. In this research, we are interested in how do machine learning techniques help in increasing accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps in the vicinity of the A1 Highway corridor. To do this, an important section at Ain Bouziane (NE, Algeria) is chosen as a case study to evaluate the landslide susceptibility using three different machine learning methods, namely, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and boosted regression tree (BRT). First, an inventory map and nine input factors were prepared for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) analyses. The three models were constructed to find the most susceptible areas to this phenomenon. The results were assessed by calculating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the standard error (Std. error), and the confidence interval (CI) at 95%. The RF model reached the highest predictive accuracy (AUC ​= ​97.2%) comparatively to the other models. The outcomes of this research proved that the obtained machine learning models had the ability to predict future landslide locations in this important road section. In addition, their application gives an improvement of the accuracy of LSMs near the road corridor. The machine learning models may become an important prediction tool that will identify landslide alleviation actions.","2020-05-01","2024-01-19 10:23:16","2024-01-19 10:23:16","","871-883","","3","11","","Geoscience Frontiers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Algeria; Boosted regression tree; Random forest; Spatial modelling; Support vector machine; Validation measures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, machine learning (ML) techniques and their ensembles may provide more accurate results. Accurate determination of drivers of LULC can guide reliable land use planning and effective natural resource management. In this study, we tested the utility of ML techniques and ensemble modelling to explain the social-ecological drivers of LULC in the Okavango basin. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) coupled with climate-based regionalization of the study area were used for LULC classification of the years 2002, 2013 and 2020. Centroids of 22 LULC transitions of the same period were used to separately calibrate five (5) machine algorithms (namely Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boost Models (GBM) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) and their ensemble. Model performance was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and the True skill statistic (TSS). Variable importance was used to assess the contribution of social-ecological variables to each LULC transition. Variables that were determined to be driving LULC were then used to predict future LULC using the Artificial Neural Network and Cellular Automata (ANN-CA). Analysis results show that average LULC classification accuracy for the study period (2002, 2013 and 2020) was (Bsh Koppen zone; OA = 95.03, Kappa = 0.94), (Cwa Koppen zone; OA = 95.29, Kappa = 0.94), Cwb Koppen zone; OA = 96.04, Kappa = 0.95). The ML ensemble performed better (ROC> 95, TSS >87) than singular ML models based on two separate model evaluation metrics. The Random Forest classifier outperformed other singular ML (ROC = 90.41, TSS = 84.2). Based on the top-performing ensemble model, distance from rivers, population density, annual average temperature, drought severity, fire frequency and distance from towns influence the conversion of natural to anthropogenic LULC classes (importance >0.5). On the other hand, distance from rivers, soil organic carbon, precipitation, GDP, elevation, population density and annual average temperature importantly influenced conversion from one natural LULC class to another natural LULC class. The study revealed that natural classes (wetland, shrubland, water and woodlands) will gradually decrease at the expense of anthropogenic classes (built-up and cultivated) in future (2040). Despite proposing the necessity of a basin-wide land-use plan to minimise pressure on resources and ensure sustainable use, findings in this study illustrate the benefit of ensemble modelling in understanding LULC dynamics in transboundary basins.","2022-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:16","2024-01-19 10:23:16","","100773","","","27","","Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Landscape change; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Spatial modelling; Water resources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes a smart soft sensor using various ML algorithms to control and predict the Coagulation and Flocculation Process (CFP). Optimizing and predicting the behaviour of a CFP is difficult due to its non-linear and complex behaviour. Therefore, ML computations is a proper method to overcome this challenge. However, one of the challenges of ML studies is the lack of sufficient data which we overcome by using an 8-year database of experiments. For prediction, this study compares different ML methods, including Random Tree, Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Quinlan’s M5 algorithm with regression function (M5P), Linear Regression (LR), Simple LR, Gaussian method, Decision Stump method, Smola and Scholkopf’s Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm with LR (SMOreg), and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Also, for optimization of the studied system, Central Composite Design designed the experimental data with the Response Surface Methodology (CCD-RSM). The most significant factors in turbidity removal are related to FeCl3 dosage, and slow mixing speed with < 0.0001 and 0.005 P-values. The present research findings show that the maximum removal efficiency of 92% is predicted using CCD-RSM under the optimal condition. In addition, ANFIS and RF models with R2 of 0.96 and 0.92, have shown the highest accuracy levels for removing water turbidity. Finally, a Petri-Net model establishes a Conceptual model to intelligently conduct managerial insights for water treatments.","2022-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:16","2024-01-19 10:23:16","","105315","","","115","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CCD-RSM; Coagulation modelling; Machine learning; Petri-net; Turbidity; Water quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach has traditionally been analyzed using only airborne LiDAR data, which limits its application to the availability of the dedicated flight campaigns. In this study we analyzed the relationship between tree species diversity and HH, calculated with four different heterogeneity indices using two freely available CHMs derived from the new space-borne GEDI LiDAR data. The first, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, was produced through a regression tree machine learning algorithm integrating GEDI LiDAR data and Landsat optical information. The second, with a spatial resolution of 10 m, was created using Sentinel-2 images and a deep learning convolutional neural network. We tested this approach separately in 30 forest plots situated in the northern Italian Alps, in 100 plots in the forested area of Traunstein (Germany) and successively in all the 130 plots through a cross-validation analysis. Forest density information was also included as influencing factor in a multiple regression analysis. Our results show that the GEDI CHMs can be used to assess biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems through the estimation of the HH that is correlated to the tree species diversity. However, the results also indicate that this method is influenced by different factors including the GEDI CHMs dataset of choice and their related spatial resolution, the heterogeneity indices used to calculate the HH and the forest density. Our finding suggest that GEDI LIDAR data can be a valuable tool in the estimation of forest tree heterogeneity and related tree species diversity in forest ecosystems, which can aid in global biodiversity estimation.","2023-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:16","2024-01-19 10:23:16","","102082","","","76","","Ecological Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Canopy height model; GEDI; Height heterogeneity; Rao’s Q index; Remote sensing; Species diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Key contributions of urban remote sensing include but are not limited to characterization of urban areas, urban land cover changes and thermal remote sensing of urban climates. Today, the proliferation of new sensors, long time series of the satellite record, joint analysis of Earth observation data with ancillary data sets, widespread availability of high-performance computing facilities, and slow but increasing use of remote sensing data and methods in non-remote sensing fields together offer new opportunities to generate scientific knowledge for an urbanizing planet. Simultaneously, the scale and pace of contemporary urbanization require new information about urban areas from both the science and policy communities. This paper examines remote sensing contributions to the scientific understanding of urban areas over the last 50 years until today. Based on this assessment and current needs by user communities, we identify four strategic directions for future urban remote sensing research: high temporal frequency analysis, characterization of urban heterogeneity, characterization of urban form and structure in two and three dimensions, and linking remote sensing with emerging urban data. Advances in these four areas are likely to generate significant new insights that will be useful to both science and policy.","2019-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:16","2024-01-19 10:23:16","","164-182","","","228","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Environmental change; Human dimensions; Review; UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Urban; Urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is a typical EEQ evaluation model used to comprehensively reflect regional ecological quality. However, owing to its complete dependence on remote sensing image information, the RSEI also has inherent issues, including unstable time series and inconsistent resolutions of its four sub-indices. To address these problems, this study used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to propose an optimisation notion for the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) coupled random forest (RF) model and determined the accuracy and image quality of the optimised RSEI (RSEIo) for the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). Based on the findings, HANTS could fill the gaps in the images, effectively reducing the noise and discrete degrees of the four indices and thereby improving the stability of the RSEI. The correlation coefficient (R) between the RSEI and RSEIo was 0.93, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.13, indicating that RSEIo is reliable. The image quality assessment (based on contrast and information entropy) indicates that HANTS combined with the RF model can produce RSEIo images with higher definitions and richer information at a constant spatial resolution. Further, the pixel-by-pixel coefficient of variation evaluation indicates that the RSEIo image was highly stabilised, yielding higher numbers of effective RSEIo images without changing the temporal resolution. Compared with traditional RSEI calculations, the optimisation proposal herein could highlight ecological differences caused by topographic changes in the YRB, which would produce an RSEI closer to actual surface conditions. Further, this proposed method could be used to obtain more detailed ecological information at a constant spatiotemporal resolution, thereby meeting the needs of long-term ecological monitoring in large-scale regions.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:16","2024-01-19 10:23:16","","101870","","","72","","Ecological Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data reconstruction; Google Earth Engine; RSEI; Thermal downscaling; Yangtze River Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, there has been a paradigm shift away from harvesting peat as a fuel towards the development of wettable peatland innovation (termed ‘paludiculture’), such as aquaculture. Such eco-innovations support carbon sequestration and align with a balanced environmental approach to protecting biodiversity. This novel peatland-based IMTA process in the Irish midlands relies upon natural microalgae for waste treatment, recirculation and water quality where there is no use of pesticides or antibiotics. This novel IMTA system is powered with a wind turbine and the process has ‘organic status’; moreover, it does not discharge aquaculture effluent to receiving water. However, there is a significant lack of understanding as to diversity of microalgae in this ‘paludiculture’-based IMTA processes. This constitutes the first case study to use conventional microscopy combined with next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to profile microalgae occurring in this novel IMTA system from pooled samples over a 12 month period in 2020. Conventional microscopy combined with classic identification revealed twenty genera of algae; with Chlorophyta and Charophyta being the most common present. However, algal DNA isolation, 16 s sequencing and bioinformatics revealed a combined total of 982 species from 341 genera across nine phyla from the same IMTA system, which emphasized a significant underestimation in the number and diversity of beneficial or potentially harmful algae in the IMTA-microbiome. These new methods also yield rich data that can be used by digital technologies to transform future monitoring and performance of the IMTA system for sustainability. The findings of this study align with many sustainability development goals of the United Nations including no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, responsible consumption and production, climate change, and life below water.","2022-12-10","2024-01-19 10:23:16","2024-01-19 10:23:16","","158392","","","851","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Algae; Aquaculture; Ecosystem; Food security; Next-generation sequencing; Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of plastic-mulched citrus (PMC) is of great importance for precision management of citrus orchards. However, monitoring the long-term and large-area PMC dynamics is challenging because the PMC is typically distributed in cloudy and rainy areas with rapid spatial variability, leading to the limited availability of high-quality remotely sensed data. Moreover, it is difficult to collect sufficient field samples in rugged mountainous regions for extracting PMC. To address these limitations, we proposed a new plastic-mulched citrus index (PMCI) based on spectral separability analysis of PMC and other land cover types. The images from Landsat-5/7/8, Sentinel-2, and Gaofen-1 satellites were employed to extract the intra-annual PMC distribution from 2019 to 2020 and interannual PMC distribution from 2008 to 2020 in Yangshuo county, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Results showed that the PMCI outperformed other widely used indices in PMC extraction with overall accuracy (OA) increased by 0.09–0.3. Besides, the PMCI exhibited good performances in extracting PMC over different observation dates with OA ranging 0.92–0.98 and 0.91–0.98 in the intra-annual and annual PMC maps, respectively. According to the derived PMC time series maps, PMC displayed significant intra-annual spatial variations in the start date and length of plastic mulching period, whereas the interannual variation of PMC revealed long-term technology adoption patterns in the study area. Furthermore, we found that temperature mainly affected intra-annual PMC variability, and that agricultural policy, market factor, neighborhood effect and variety replacement can explain the interannual PMC variability. These results indicate that the developed PMCI can effectively identify PMC over different agricultural regions and observation dates, and the resultant spatio-temporal dynamic PMC maps based on multi-source satellite data provide an important basis for the promotion of PMC at larger scales and the sustainable development of the citrus industry.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:16","2024-01-19 10:23:16","","126981","","","151","","European Journal of Agronomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Intra-annual and interannual analysis; Multi-source remote sensing data; Plastic-mulched citrus index; Spatio-temporal variation; Spectral separability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advanced prediction of PM10 hotspots can ensure adequate preparedness for air quality management and minimize its effects. The PM10 data acquired for 2012–2016 in Malaysia's urbanized and populated state, Selangor, was used for the modelling. The PM10 was modelled using remote sensing data such as elevation, slope, road density, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, Normalized difference Vegetation Index, built-up index, land surface temperature, and wind speed. Spatial modelling of the PM10 hotspot was done using a Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithms. Results revealed a good prediction of PM10 hotspot with model performance for KNN, RF, and NB are in terms of specificity: 0.98, 0.99, 0.92; precision: 0.98, 0.99, 0,92; recall: 0.94, 0.98, 0.91; and the overall accuracy is 0.96, 0.98, 0.91, respectively. The PM10 hotspot map produced by the RF model indicates that urbanized and industrialized areas have high PM10 concentration, which characterizes the harmful effect of air pollutants in urbanized regions.

Research objective The main goals of this research were to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of seven agrometeorological drought indices at a regional scale in Pakistan. Secondly, to forecast the wheat yield loss risk (YLR) due to droughts under current and future climate scenarios by employing three machine learning (ML) methods; random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and generalized additive model (GAM). Method The relationship between detrended wheat yield and a combination of five remote sensing indices Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI), and Drought Severity Index (DSI)), and two meteorological drought indices (Palmer’s Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)) was analyzed. Mann-Kendall trend (MK), Sens’s slope, and Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) tests are applied to explore the trend and trend-changing years for all indices over the historical time of 20 years. The YLR and all indices were projected (2021–2050) from the baseline period (2001–2020) using PROPHET time series forecasting and CMIP6 climatic models. YLR was forecasted on present and future projected time series by employing three non-linear ML regression models. Results The output of the drought analysis revealed that the study area was hit by high to severe drought events in 2001–2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2017. Trend analysis revealed intersection years breaking the rising trend of drought indices. All drought indices are significantly correlated with meteorological wheat yield with a sequence of NDWI>DSI>VCI>VHI>PDSI>SPEI>TCI. Future projections under high emission scenarios revealed a rise in YLR associated with frequent projected droughts from VHI, DSI, SPEI, and PDSI. YLR forecasting from agrometeorological indices is best predicted by random forest with the lowest RMSE = 0.005314.

Clouds limit the utility of optical satellite data to monitor cropland abandonment in highly fragmented mountain agricultural landscapes of tropical and subtropical regions, including the south of China. Taking Nanjing County of China as an example, we developed a novel approach by utilizing multisource satellite (Landsat and Sentinel-2) imagery to map multiple trajectories of cropland abandonment (transitioning from cropland to grassland, shrubs and forest) in subtropical mountainous landscapes. Then, we employed a redundancy analysis (RDA) to identify the spatial association of cropland abandonment considering agricultural productivity, physiography, locational characteristics and economic factors. Results indicate the great suitability of harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images to distinguish multiple trajectories of cropland abandonment in subtropical mountainous areas. Our framework of mapping cropland abandonment resulted in good producer's (78.2%) and user's (81.3%) accuracies. The statistical analysis showed 31.85% of croplands cultivated in 2000 were abandoned by 2018, and more than a quarter of townships experienced cropland abandonment with high abandoned rates (>38%). Cropland abandonment mainly occurred in relatively unfavorable areas for agricultural production, for instance with a slope above 6°. Slope and the proximity to the nearest settlement explained 65.4% and 8.1% of the variation of cropland abandonment at the township level, respectively. The developed approaches on both mapping cropland abandonment and modeling determinants can be highly relevant to monitor multiple trajectories of cropland abandonment and ascribe their determinants not only in mountainous China but also elsewhere and thus promote the formulation of land-use policies that aim to steer cropland abandonment.","2023-06-15","2024-01-19 10:23:19","2024-01-19 10:23:19","","117621","","","336","","Journal of Environmental Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cropland abandonment; Redundancy analysis (RDA); Rural landscape; Satellite remote sensing; Support vector machines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The land cover change analysis revealed that forest areas, particularly those dominated by the threatened sal tree (Shorea robusta), were converted into other land-use classes. Bangladesh-specific development indicators from the World Bank were also incorporated into the study to better understand the underlying situation. The results support the formation of policies and planning to reverse forest degradation as per the Paris Climate Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.

This study focuses on the impact of prevailing social and ecological conditions on the potential equity outcome of REDD+ intervention at the local level. Working at a REDD+ pilot project site in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we present a quantitative framework to assess contextual equity at the village level. We conducted a full community census on household characteristics and livelihood practices to evaluate current social conditions. We used participatory mapping and remote sensing analysis of a time series of very high resolution imagery over a 10-year period within the village boundaries to examine the ecological context of land use. We identify important differences between 379 households in terms of social characteristics and livelihoods practices. Social differentiation strongly relates to customary land rights as well as gender, ethnicity and origin. Using this case study, we find REDD+ activities that can be implemented under the prevailing ecological conditions could impact community members differently, by reducing access to land for a segment of the population that is already under stress, and therefore have implications on equity in both space and time. We identify important risks for sectors of the population that do not have the contextual features necessary for benefitting from REDD+ implementation and may be impacted, directly and indirectly, by decisions linked to benefit-sharing. We argue that such quantitative assessment is valuable to inform REDD+ policy design on the way livelihood practices and social characteristics are interlinked and how they affect forest cover change. This information can be used to anticipate potential equity issues that may arise with REDD+ implementation. We suggest that contextually informed definitions of the benefits and costs are critical for achieving equity in benefit-sharing. A flexible adaptive management and equity conscious approach is recommended from the policy design to implementation, by anticipating and mitigating potential risks of REDD+ interventions in order to promote equitable outcomes at the local level.","2018-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:19","2024-01-19 10:23:19","","102-115","","","75","","Land Use Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Benefit sharing; Customary system; Democratic Republic of Congo; Equity; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dongting Lake is a typical seasonal lake in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and its hydrological conditions have changed significantly due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). However, there are knowledge gaps in the responses of wetland vegetation dynamics to the changes of hydrological conditions, especially in cloudy and rainy regions, where continuous large-scale monitoring is still challenging. In this study, by using time series of Landsat data on Google Earth Engine, a long-term cloudless remote sensing images dataset of Dongting Lake during the dry season was constructed. The multi-year wetland vegetation from 2003 to 2020 was mapped using the random forest model. Relationships between wetland vegetation dynamics and hydrological conditions (e.g., water level and inundation character) were examined using correlation and linear analysis. Results revealed that wetland vegetation in the Dongting Lake experienced significant inter-annual spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamic equilibrium with a slight increase during the post-TGD period. Only Carex communities at elevations above 28 m and below 26 m displayed apparent changes. Reed communities have relatively high selectivity to inundation frequency, and are affected mainly by changes in water levels during the dry season of the current year. Hydrological conditions during the rising period have an important impact on the first growth and reproduction stage of Carex, while higher water levels or more rapid surface submergence lead to a decrease in seed density in the soil of low-elevation floodplains. This study deepens our knowledge of changes of wetland vegetation and their response to hydrological conditions, and is of great significance to the ecological protection and restoration of Dongting Lake.","2022-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:22","2024-01-19 10:23:22","","109283","","","142","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dongting Lake; Google Earth Engine; Random forest model; Vegetation change; Water level","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we assess the crop yield response of major crops to meteorological drought estimated by a standardized precipitation index with multiple timescales (1–12 months) during 1981–2016 all over the globe. We estimate that about one- to two-thirds of global harvested areas of maize, rice, soybean, and wheat, were significantly affected by various drought timescales. Soybean and wheat might respond to more prolonged droughts, while rice and maize responded to short-medium drought time scales. Using multiple machine learning models, we reveal that set of determinants could explain most variations of crop response to drought timescale with average accuracies between 45.7% and 56.0% (across models and crop types). Moreover, this study suggests that crops in warmer and higher water availability (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration) might respond significantly to more short-term drought. The other factors (i.e., socioeconomic, fertilizer, soil, topography, production, irrigation) shows a complex and weaker effect on defining crop vulnerability to the various drought characteristics.

Population growth, migration, and rural exodus have led to spatial expansion in many cities worldwide, especially in coastal urban settings. This research aims at assessing and predicting LULC over the Agoènyivé plateau (AP) in Togo, using remote sensing and Markov Chain along with local perceptions on LULC change, thus considering four scenarios (i.e., Business-as Usual, afforestation, wetland policy, and building policy). LULC was classified based on the maximum likelihood algorithm using Landsat images. The future scenarios maps were produced using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks-Markov chain modelling approach by considering five driver variables considered to affect future development. The historical change analysis was performed for the periods of 1986–2001, 2001–2011, and 2011–2020, while 1986–2020 was used for model validation and change prediction. Image accuracy assessment was performed using the error or confusion matrices, kappa coefficients (Kscores), Relative Operating Characteristics (ROC), and accuracy scores, with an overall accuracy (Kappa coefficient) of 87% (0.81), 88% (0.81), 90% (0.82), and 92% (0.84) for the years 1986, 2001, 2011, and 2020, respectively. The results showed an increase in built-up areas (38.71% land gain), while a decrease was observed in mixed vegetation/savannah (22.69% land loss), croplands/bare surfaces (22.89%), and wetlands (3.36% land loss) over the period of 1986–2020. An increase in built-up areas (7.79% and 19.79% land gain by 2030 and 2050, respectively) and a decrease in mixed vegetation (1.13% and 2.54% land loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), croplands and bare surfaces (6.58% and 16.98% loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), and wetlands (0.13% and 0.31% loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), are expected under the BAU scenario. Contrary to the wetland policy, which induces change only in the wetlands (0.02% and 0.047% land loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), the afforestation scenario results in a gain in forest/savannah (0.11% and 0.73% land gain by 2030 and 2050 compared to the BAU scenario), but also a decrease in croplands/bare surfaces (0.64% by 2050 compared to the BAU scenario), whereas the building policy scenario results in a long-term increase in croplands/bare surfaces (2.88% by 2050, compared to the BAU), and wetlands (0.027 and 2.88% by 2050) in addition to the mixed vegetation/savannah. LULC dynamics (including future urbanization trends) for the AP under various scenarios is a step ahead of time, highlighting the importance of the implementation of existing laws and policies, but also providing information to deal with the observed inharmonious spatial development of urban centres, and serving as a dataset source for LULC change impact assessments on related resources.","2023-04-01","2024-01-19 10:23:22","2024-01-19 10:23:22","","100928","","","30","","Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agoènyivé plateau; Driver variables; Markov chain; Multilayer perceptron (MLP); Togo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Guangdong Province, China, with annual CO2 emissions of 585 Mt, is chosen as the case study for this paper. The results show that the deployment of the carbon capture utilization and storage supply chain follows a pattern of spreading from coastal to inland regions as the CO2 net reduction rate increases.

The CO2-derived methanol is not economically viable, while having low implied carbon emissions, it has approximately 2.5 times the unit cost of traditional methanol. We recommend promoting carbon trading due to its effectiveness in reducing the unit abatement cost.

In this regard, the crucial role of nanotechnology in modern farming is emphasized as an efficient means to develop “precision farming” systems. It can play a potent role in promoting sustainable agriculture, improving nutrient utilization, and mitigating climate change and environmental pollution. Particularly, nanotechnology-enabled products such as “smart nano-delivery capsules” offer new opportunities for controlled slow release of diverse deliverables (e.g., pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and micronutrients) in compliance with the needs of plants under specific environmental stimuli responses. In this framework, this review explores the basic properties, application benefits, and future directions of nanotechnology in agricultural economics, particularly for promoting crop growth and soil reclamation under the umbrella of SDG targets. All obstacles for applying agri-nanotech products (agri-NPs) in farming have been identified and discussed, considering their life cycle assessment (LCA) in soil and plants. Emphasis has been made on evaluating the impacts of various nanotech products on crop growth in reference to traditional market technologies. Besides, this review work discusses the benefits of nanobiochar and nanobubbles as viable alternative natural nanotech products to promote crop physiology, alleviate environmental pollution, and sequester carbon in the soil. This work also summarizes the technical aspects associated with the conversion of agricultural biomass wastes into affordable biofuels. It also highlights regulations, legislative policies, and economic outputs to strengthen the public awareness and acceptance of nanotechnologies in agro-environmental fields. The opportunities and challenges in these topics are discussed to help actively develop and implement nano-enabled products in agriculture and related industries.","2021-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:22","2024-01-19 10:23:22","","111686","","","152","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conduct an initial assessment of the temporal urban growth pattern in last 15 years using Landsat data and published landuse maps, demonstrating that the urban growth has percolated to unstable geomorphic units, making it vulnerable to flooding. Geoenvironmental factors (geomorphology, lithology, structure, land use, soil, slope and groundwater) based multi-thematic data integration approach is adopted to delineate UGP zones using heuristic and machine learning techniques like Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR). We used present-day field observations to train the predictive models like ANN, LR & RF and test the outcomes with accuracy assessment ratios (detection percentage, miss factor etc.). The ANN-derived result presents the best accuracy with a detection percentage of 85% and predicts a 55% spatial scope of urban expansion, which was further refined using the mask of the strategic and ecologically sensitive location with appropriate buffers. The final map represents the UGP zones within the city and surroundings, encompassing stable landform units.

This study focused on analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of golden seaweed (Ectocarpus siliculosus) coverage at Dollymount Strand in Dublin Bay (Ireland), between 2016 and 2022, and its relationship with meteorological conditions. Hyperspectral measurements in the field and Sentinel-2 imagery were utilized to monitor macroalgal blooms with a spatiotemporal resolution of 10 m and minimum costs. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values filtered between 0.1 and 1 were used to identify the coverage of golden seaweeds. The results showed that the golden seaweed coverage extended over 99% of the study area (54 ha) in June 2020 with an average NDVI of 0.25. A seasonal pattern of golden seaweed abundance was observed and modelled from May to October using a Generalized Additive Model. Approximately 28% of the coverage was correlated with daily average global radiance, and 38% of the mean NDVI was associated with daily average maximum air temperatures and wind direction by means of the Generalized Linear Models. A greater biomass of Ectocarpus spp. was accumulated on the beach when the wind direction was from the north-east and south-east. The results also suggested that freshwater nutrient inputs in winter from nearby estuaries may be contributing to golden tides on the shoreline. These findings are useful in developing strategies aimed at controlling and managing golden tides globally, as well as using them as bioindicators of ecological status in coastal environments.","2023-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:22","2024-01-19 10:23:22","","103451","","","122","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomass; Coverage; Environmental management; Macroalgae; Remote sensing; Spectral analysis; Transitional waters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper answers that question by developing an analytical framework for identifying UGS deserts – areas without adequate UGS availability level – considering various walking distance thresholds. We first demonstrate how geographic distributions of UGS deserts can change depending on different walking distance thresholds (e.g., 100, 300, 500 m) of choice. Unreliable and inaccurate detection of UGS deserts can hinder evidence-based land use planning for promoting healthy cities and result in erroneous social equity evaluation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce and examine robust UGS oases and deserts: geographic areas with and without the per capita green space (PCG) level recommended by a local government regardless of different walking distance thresholds used, respectively. With the identified robust UGS deserts and oases, we perform a social equity analysis to investigate inequality and whether there are systematic disadvantages for socioeconomically vulnerable populations to access UGS in Dhaka, a rapidly developing capital city in Bangladesh. The robust UGS deserts approach enables more reliable and informed decision-making to enhance UGS availability and its social equity, thereby facilitating an optimal development of urban policy for healthy cities. More practically, our robust UGS deserts method can be an effective alternative to detect UGS deserts when guidelines for walking distance thresholds are missing which is often the case in low- and middle-income countries.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:22","2024-01-19 10:23:22","","128123","","","89","","Urban Forestry & Urban Greening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Availability; Bangladesh; Global South; Healthy cities; Social equity; Urban green space","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each FUA includes the city and its commuting zone as inferred from statistical modelling of available spatial data. FUAs represent the economic area of influence of each urban centre. Hence, the analysis of land consumption within their boundary has significance in the fields of spatial planning and policy analyses as well as many other research areas. We utilize the boundaries of more than 9,000 FUAs to estimate the land use efficiency between 1990 and 2015, by using population and built-up area data extracted from the Global Human Settlement Layer. This analysis shows how, in the observed period, FUAs in low-income countries of the Global South evolved with rates of population growth surpassing the ones of land consumption. However, in almost all regions of the globe, more than half of the FUAs improved their land use efficiency in recent years (2000–2015) with respect to the previous decade (1990–2000).

During the past few years, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a constant reminder of about the importance of hygiene and sanitation for public health. The most common approach to securing clean water supplies for this purpose is via wastewater treatment. To date, an effective method of detecting wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) accurately and automatically via remote sensing is unavailable. In this paper, we provide a solution to this task by proposing a novel joint deep learning (JDL) method that consists of a fine-tuned object detection network and a multi-task residual attention network (RAN). By leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) and multimodal remote sensing (RS) data, our JDL method is able to simultaneously tackle two different tasks: land use land cover (LULC) and WWTP classification. Moreover, JDL exploits the complementary effects between these tasks for a performance gain. We train JDL using 4,187 WWTP features and 4,200 LULC samples and validate the performance of the proposed method over a selected area around Stuttgart with 723 WWTP features and 1,200 LULC samples to generate an LULC classification map and a WWTP detection map. Extensive experiments conducted with different comparative methods demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our JDL method in automatic WWTP detection in comparison with single-modality/single-task or traditional survey methods. Moreover, lessons learned pave the way for future works to simultaneously and effectively address multiple large-scale mapping tasks (e.g., both mapping LULC and detecting WWTP) from multimodal RS data via deep learning.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:23","2024-01-19 10:23:23","","102804","","","110","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GeoAI; multi-task learning; multimodal; object detection; OpenStreetMap; SDG 6; volunteered geographic information; wastewater treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, research on habitat quality and ecological security patterns in arid desert regions is limited. Given the research gap, this study constructed and optimized the ecological security pattern of Jiziwan (which refers to areas similar to the shape of the Chinese character “几”) in the Yellow River Basin. To achieve the aim, high habitat quality areas obtained from the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model were used as “sources”, and ecological corridors were identified from the Minimal Cumulative Resistance (MCR) model. Simultaneously, this study integrated land use, natural, social, and economic factors to monitor and assess the impact of urban expansion on habitat quality in Jiziwan. The results showed that: (1) urban expansion and ecological land have become more fragmented in Jiziwan and the urban expansion has changed from the edge-expansion type to the outlying type; (2) from 2000 to 2020, the urban expansion rate increased from 25.95% to 97.58%, which was negatively correlated with the rate of change in good habitat quality; (3) we finally identified 45 important ecological corridors, 140 secondary ecological corridors, and 44 ecological nodes that form an ecological spatial pattern of “two barriers, three corridors, and seven zones”. Our analytical framework offers a valuable tool for constructing ecological security patterns in Jiziwan and selecting “sources” at the regional scale. It can be applied to other landscapes and geographical contexts for sustainable development in arid regions.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:23","2024-01-19 10:23:23","","109544","","","145","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Arid region; Ecological security patterns; Habitat quality; InVEST; MCR; Sustainable development goals (SDGs); Urban expansion; Urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An accurate assessment of the global status of mangrove forests warrants the necessity of datasets with sufficient information on spatial distributions and patch patterns. However, existing datasets were mostly derived from ∼30 m resolution satellite imagery and used pixel-based image classification methods, which lacked spatial details and reasonable geo-information. Here, based on Sentinel-2 imagery, we created a global mangrove forest dataset at 10-m resolution, namely, High-resolution Global Mangrove Forests (HGMF_2020), using object-based image analysis and random forest classification. We then analyzed the status of global mangrove forests from the perspectives of conservation, threats, and resistance to ocean disasters. We concluded the following: (1) globally, there were 145,068 km2 mangrove forests in 2020, among which Asia contained the largest coverage (39.2%); at the country level, Indonesia had the largest amount of mangrove forests, followed by Brazil and Australia. (2) Mangrove forests in South Asia were estimated to be in the better status due to the higher proportion of conservation and larger individual patch size; in contrast, mangrove forests in East and Southeast Asia were facing intensive threats. (3) Nearly, 99% of mangrove forest areas had a patch width greater than 100 m, suggesting that nearly all mangrove forests were efficient in reducing coastal wave energy and impacts.

A supervised classification of Landsat images (1986, 2010, and 2020) using the Random Forest algorithm was performed, as well as a post-classification comparison of LULC maps in terms of area and size. A “from–to” matrix was used to identify the changes in LULC that occurred between the periods 1986–2010, 2010–2020, and 1986–2020. The results show an overall classification accuracy of 88.9, 88.5, and 88% for LULC maps for the years 1986, 2010, and 2020, respectively. Between the period 1986 and 2020, there is a conversion of the greater part of dense forest to open forest, and subsequently to settlement and cropland as a major historical LULC change pattern in the Tano basin. Cropland and Settlement increased at the rate of 24.8 km/yr and 1.5 km/yr respectively, while Dense forest and Open forest decreased at the rate of 298.4 km/yr and 173.9 km/yr over the period 1986 to 2020.

Spatiotemporal change analysis and ecological sensitivity assessment are the important prerequisites for investigating the relationship between eco-environmental quality and human activities. In this study, the tropical forest and other land cover types in Jinghong, China were firstly classified by a machine learning classification algorithm (support vector machine, SVM) with 7 pairs of remote sensing (RS) data (from 1989 to 2018). Then the spatiotemporal change patterns were analyzed. The ecological sensitivity was evaluated based on an index system method (ISM) in which a weighted combination of eleven indicators were produced using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and GIS. Meanwhile four individual sensitivity indicators, including biodiversity sensitivity (BS), water resources sensitivity (WRS), geological hazard sensitivity (GHS) and soil erosion sensitivity (SES) were assessed respectively to create a multi-perspective understanding of the entire ecological sensitivity. The results suggest that the tropical forest experienced a continual decrease from 5631.78 km2 in 1999 to 4216.23 km2 in 2018 with an average change rate of −1.49%. The decreased area was mainly encroached on by human settlements and agriculture, particularly in the south of Jinghong. Furthermore, it could be seen that urbanization is the key driver for the changes to ecological sensitivity with both positive and negative impacts. In Jinghong, the region covered by a tropical forest has a relatively higher comprehensive ecological sensitivity (CES) than that of an urban area. This work shows RS and GIS to be powerful tools providing profound insights to researchers with regard to the spatiotemporal evolution of tropical forests and ecological sensitivity. The results are significant for improving policies in order to keep a sustainable balance in regional ecosystem management.","2020-07-20","2024-01-19 10:23:25","2024-01-19 10:23:25","","138678","","","727","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AHP; Ecological sensitivity; GIS; RS; Spatiotemporal evolution; Tropical forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regulation of this industry has varied over time and while industrial mining is prevalent in the country, the expansion of artisanal mining, or Galamsey has escalated in recent years. Many of these artisanal mines are not only harmful to human health due to the use of Mercury (Hg) in the amalgamation process, but also leave a significant footprint on terrestrial ecosystems, degrading and destroying forested ecosystems in the region. In this study, the Landsat image archive available through Google Earth Engine was used to quantify the total footprint of vegetation loss due to artisanal gold mines in Ghana from 2005 to 2019 and understand how conversion of forested regions to mining has changed over a decadal period from 2007 to 2017. A combination of machine learning and change detection algorithms were used to calculate different land cover conversions and the timing of conversion annually. Within the study area of southwestern Ghana, our results indicate that approximately 47,000 ha (⨦2218 ha) of vegetation were converted to mining at an average rate of ~2600 ha yr−1. The results indicate that a high percentage (~50%) of this mining occurred between 2014 and 2017. Around 700 ha of this mining occurred within protected areas as mapped by the World Database of Protected Areas. In addition to deforestation, increased artisanal mining activity in recent years has the potential to affect human health, access to drinking water resources and food security. This work expands upon limited research into the spatial footprint of Galamsey in Ghana, complements mapping efforts by local geographers, and will support efforts by the government of Ghana to monitor deforestation caused by artisanal mining.","2021-08-10","2024-01-19 10:23:25","2024-01-19 10:23:25","","146644","","","781","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Extent mapping; Galamsey; Google Earth Engine; Landsat; NDVI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing vehicle emission due to inefficient urban form is thought to be the main cause of traffic congestion and increased PM2.5 concentrations. Previous efforts attributing PM2.5 concentrations to urban forms are yet to reach consistent conclusions on practical environmental protection strategies. In this study, we considered urban compositions and their spatial configuration to propose a new measurement—urban configuration—and document the effects of urban configuration on PM2.5 concentrations. Using 330 Chinese cities as our sample, we found that the areas of two types of urban facilities, namely, residence and industry, are positively related to PM2.5 concentrations, and the area of public service facilities is negatively related to PM2.5 concentrations. Regarding the spatial configuration of different urban compositions, we documented that residence–industry accessibility is a key factor of PM2.5 concentrations and plays a more important role than the residence–commerce accessibility. We also compared the influence of two accessibility indices (distance- and gravity-based accessibilities) and further found that the effect of reducing the residence–industry distance is more remarkable than the effect of increasing residential or industrial area on reducing PM2.5 concentrations. Our results indicate that the key to reaching sustainable urban expansion is to synchronize urban constructions with spatial configuration optimization. For Chinese cities, a 7.52% increase in residence area requires at least 1% decrease in the average residence–industry distance to eliminate the incremental effects of newly constructed residential region on PM2.5 concentrations. This study casts new light on the relationship between urban configuration and PM2.5 concentration and provides decision makers practical and realistic approaches in realizing sustainable development goals.","2022-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:25","2024-01-19 10:23:25","","107129","","","161","","Environment International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PM concentration; Residence–industry accessibility; Spatial configuration; Sustainable development; Urban configuration; Urban form","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evapotranspiration (ET) mitigates the urban heat island, reducing the effect of heat waves. It can also be used as a proxy for vegetation water use, making it a crucial tool to plan resilient green cities. To optimize the trade-off between urban greening and water security, reliable and up-to-date maps of ET for cities are urgently needed. Despite its importance, few studies have mapped urban ET accurately for an entire city in high spatial and temporal resolution. We mapped the ET of Berlin, Germany in high spatial (10-m) and temporal (hourly) resolution for the year of 2019. A novel machine learning (ML) approach combining Sentinel-2 time series, open geodata, and flux footprint modeling was applied. Two eddy flux towers with contrasting surrounding land cover provided the training and testing data. Flux footprint modeling allowed us to incorporate comprehensive land cover types in training the ML models. Open remote sensing and geodata used as model inputs included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, building height, impervious surface fraction, vegetation fraction, and vegetation height. NDVI was used to indicate vegetation phenology and health, as plant transpiration contributes to the majority of terrestrial ET. Hourly reference ET (RET) was calculated and used as input to capture the temporal dynamics of the meteorological conditions. Predictions were carried out using Random Forest (RF) regression. Weighted averages extracted from hourly ET maps using flux footprints were compared to measured ET from the two flux towers. Validation showed that the approach is reliable for mapping urban ET, with a mean R2 of 0.76 and 0.56 and a mean RMSE of 0.0289 mm and 0.0171 mm at the more vegetated site and the city-center site, respectively. Lastly, the variation of ET between Local Climate Zones (LCZs) was analyzed to support urban planning. This study demonstrated the capacity to map urban ET at an unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution with a novel methodology, which can be used to support the sustainable management of green infrastructure and water resources in an urbanizing world facing climate change.","2023-03-15","2024-01-19 10:23:25","2024-01-19 10:23:25","","113487","","","287","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cooling cities; High resolution; Latent heat flux; Local Climate Zones (LCZs); Nature-based solutions; NDVI; Phenology; Satellite remote sensing; Transpiration; Urban heat island (UHI); Urban planning; Water scarcity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to support the practice of relevant policies from the scientific perspective, it is essential to precisely estimate the carbon storage of arbor forest, as it plays an important role in the carbon cycle of ecosystems. In this study, we first used the latest four phases of national forest inventory data to investigate the variation of carbon storage for both natural and planted arbor forest in China during the covered period (1999-2018). Then we used machine leaning methods to simulate the carbon density based on various kinds of environmental factors and analyzed the contribution of each influencing factor. Our results demonstrate that the total carbon storage for arbor forest in China kept increasing over the last two decades, but this increment was mainly brought about by the continuous expansion of forest land. The gap of carbon sequestration between natural forest and planted forest showed a significant trend of reduction. Additionally, tree age was identified as the dominant factor for influencing the spatiotemporal variation of carbon density among all the independent variables while the impact of climatic factor was limited. Therefore, the future improvement of carbon sequestration of arbor forest in should mainly rely on additional projects of afforestation, reforestation, green space conservation and reduction of emissions in China. Conclusions of this study have important implications for policy makers and other stakeholders to evaluate the previous achievement of environmental projects and can also help to set future plans and finally realize the goals of carbon neutrality.","2022-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","688-696","","5","2","","Fundamental Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon density; Carbon storage; Forest stand volume; Machine learning; National forestry inventory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides the low animal support capacity and vegetative yield, degraded pastures also contribute significantly to soil carbon losses, through CO2 emission. This study aimed to understand the temporal dynamics of atmospheric CO2 in contrast between degraded pastures (DP) and managed pastures (MP) in the Cerrado Brazil biome. Using the Pasture Atlas and 6-year time series, the variables were collected under the pasture classes: column-average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (xCO2), Soil Carbon Stock (SCS), as well as Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) as vegetative characteristics, and Land Surface Temperature Amplitude (LST Amplitude) and Precipitation as climatic aspects. Except for xCO2, MP was significantly different from DP with higher SIF, NDVI, LAI, Precipitation, and SCS, but smaller LST Amplitude. The hypothesis test (Student t-test p < 0.05) results indicate higher Precipitation and SCS in MP when compared to DP due to its positive effect of higher vegetative values. Linear regression and Pearson's correlation analysis indicate that xCO2 negatively relates to the precipitation and vegetative variables (NDVI, LAI, and SIF), but positively with LST Amplitude and SCS. Soil carbon stock obtained a significant xCO2 relationship (p < 0.001) only in the DP, suggesting that the environmental stress experienced by degraded pastures impacts soil carbon losses as a source of CO2. Therefore, this study concludes that DP with carbon stored in the soil is the main source of CO2 for the atmosphere when compared to MP. So, if the necessary care is not taken, the organic carbon from these degraded pastures will be lost to the atmosphere as CO2. These findings may favor nature-based solutions indicating that proper pasture management is an important aspect to mitigate emissions and improving soil carbon content helping to mitigate atmospheric CO2.","2022-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","100848","","","28","","Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate changes; LST; Nature-based; OCO-2; Remote sensing; SoilGrids; Solutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eight advanced machine learning algorithms were applied to determine the probability of the occurrence of wetlands. The random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) models outperformed others. So, these models were further used to create a stacking ensemble for improving precision. The RF-SVM-MARS ensemble model was run with seven various parameters. The results show that the integrated parameter has the highest area under the curve (0.960) followed by optical-hydrogeomorphic (0.953), SAR-hydrogeomorphic (0.940), hydrogeomorphic (0.896), SAR-optical (0.892), optical (0.881), and SAR (0.702). The hydrogeomorphic variables exhibited greater influence than the optical and SAR variables. However, the integration of all selected key variables proved to be the most effective approach for probabilistic wetland mapping. The RF-SVM-MARS ensemble model can improve classification accuracy as compared to a single model. An accuracy of 96% was obtained when the ensemble model output was cross-validated with field data. The ground-penetrating radar (GPR) tool was also successfully employed to study the sub-surface strata and water level conditions in wetland and non-wetland areas. The successful application of a new ensemble approach along with the GPR technique for coastal wetland mapping in this study could encourage researchers to choose it as an appropriate methodology.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was applied to predict the QWI by using the algorithm of feed forward back propagation artificial neural networks (BP ANN) for optimization. Physio-chemical assessments indicated that, water resources did not conform to the safe limits, especially heavy metals likes cadmium, which has the highest concentrations-hazard in almost all samples. High lead levels were observed at nineteen sites, while a high concentrations of nickel, and Total dissolved solids were observed at seven locations. The microbial assessment indicated most of locations did not conform to the safe limits, a high bacteria –hazard for Total coliform and Escherichia coli were observed in fourteen, and seven locations, respectively. Computed WQI values ranged from 35.61 to 337.52. ANN model showed much high prediction accuracy of WQI modeling with R2 values greater than 0.95 during training, testing and validation. WQI spatial distribution shown that, Red Sea State has unsuitable water quality in most of study sites (70%). The effects of heavy pollutants dominated on the water quality, and spread in these regions. This study conducted the first full-scale survey of the drinking water sources (ground and surface) in the Red Sea State of Sudan. Based on these results, we recommended that, an urgent measures such as a chemical treatments to treat the pollution, with/or filters installation should be implemented as soon as possible to manage and protect the water resources.","2021-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","100612","","","14","","Groundwater for Sustainable Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial neural networks (ANN); Heavy metals; Red sea state; SDS Limits; Sudan; Water quality index (WQI); WHO Limits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a strategic priority of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), public policies and global initiatives. The operability and functionality of critical infrastructure are continuously challenged by multiple stressors, increasing demands and ageing, whilst their interconnectedness and dependencies pose additional challenges. Emerging and disruptive digital technologies have the potential to enhance climate resilience of critical infrastructure, by providing rapid and accurate assessment of asset condition and support decision-making and adaptation. In this pursuit, it is imperative to adopt multidisciplinary roadmaps and deploy computational, communication and other digital technologies, tools and monitoring systems. Nevertheless, the potential of these emerging technologies remains largely unexploited, as there is a lack of consensus, integrated approaches and legislation in support of their use. In this perspective paper, we discuss the main challenges and enablers of climate-resilient infrastructure and we identify how available roadmaps, tools and emerging digital technologies, e.g. Internet of Things, digital twins, point clouds, Artificial Intelligence, Building Information Modelling, can be placed at the service of a safer world. We show how digital technologies will lead to infrastructure of enhanced resilience, by delivering efficient and reliable decision-making, in a proactive and/or reactive manner, prior, during and after hazard occurrences. In this respect, we discuss how emerging technologies significantly reduce the uncertainties in all phases of infrastructure resilience evaluations. Thus, building climate-resilient infrastructure, aided by digital technologies, will underpin critical activities globally, contribute to Net Zero target and hence safeguard our societies and economies. To achieve this we set an agenda, which is aligned with the relevant SDGs and highlights the urgent need to deliver holistic and inclusive standards and legislation, supported by coordinated alliances, to fully utilise emerging digital technologies.","2022-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","100387","","","35","","Climate Risk Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Critical infrastructure; Data-driven; Emerging digital technologies; Sustainable development goals (SDGs)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High temporal and spectral resolutions of Landsat images, with a low saturation level of spectral bands with the integration of indices, are the main factors that ensured >90% overall accuracy of land cover maps. Over the last three decades (1990–2020), the annual rate of change calculation, cross-tabulated method, and fragmentation analysis were carried out to identify the changes in mangrove cover. Overall, the findings of this paper revealed that, at the national scale, an estimated 477.22 km2 was covered with mangrove in 1990, which increased to 1463.59 km2 in 2020, a 3.74% annual rate of change. Mangrove fragmentation mapping results have also showed enhancement in mangrove tree canopy density. Due to planting and effective conservation practices, the current study shows positive changes in mangrove cover across all five study sites.

The primary focus of pedometricians has traditionally been on spatial and spatio-temporal soil inventories with numerical soil classification, geostatistical modelling of spatial variation and mapping. The rapid development of remote and proximal soil sensing as well as data-driven statistical modelling techniques have had a major impact on pedometrics over the past decades. During this time, a general demand for quantitative digital soil information for environmental modelling and management has compelled pedometricians to address other soil-related questions from a quantitative point of view: soil genesis and utility and quality of soil. While scientific progress is largely an autonomous process that is difficult to steer, research efforts could benefit from an agenda with pressing pedometric research topics. This paper defines and discusses ten recent or longstanding pedometrics challenges, with the attempt to identify knowledge gaps and suggest new concepts and methods to overcome them. The ten challenges were selected through a collaborative effort and may serve as a guidance for future pedometrics research and to foster collaboration among soil scientists.

MODIS products, in particular, are used to study the dynamics of land use and floods after demonstrating high validation with statistical data and radar satellites, with R2 = 0.96 and R2 ≥ 0.97 for land use and flood maps, respectively. The results show that rice cultivation is the most dominant land use type, accounting for 40% to 46% of the delta area, while aquaculture accounts for 10% to 22%, respectively. The total rice cultivation area increased from 3764 thousand hectares (thous. ha) in 2001 to 4343 thous. ha in 2015 based on the intensive development of triple rice cropping in the upper zone, then decreased to 3963 thous. ha in 2020. In contrast, aquaculture areas are farmed mainly in the coastal area and remained relatively steady, increasing slightly from 619 thous. ha in 2001 to 856 thous. ha in 2020. The massive construction of dikes for triple rice cropping in the upper zone appears to cause a significant impact on the annual flooding regime.

An adequate application of fertilizers is essential for sustainable agricultural productivity. This research aims to determine soil fertility and provide precise fertilizer to improve crop yield. Many researchers have proposed soil fertility classification using deep learning-based approaches, such as extreme learning machines (ELMs) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Although both ELM and MLP have the highest performance, insufficient training data prevent them from being useful. To address this limitation, this research proposes a 1D convolution neural networks (1D-CNN)-based soil fertility classification method that is straightforward, compact, and supports scalar additions and multiplications. To classify soil fertility, the classifier employs laboratory-measured soil data that encompasses electrical conductivity, pH, organic carbon, potassium, phosphorus, sulfur, boron, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc. The proposed approach employs MinMax normalization and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to improve the classifier performance. The results of soil classification are used to recommend fertilizers. An experimental study using a laboratory-measured soil dataset showed that the proposed technique outperformed ELM and MLP classifiers. The proposed approach outperformed ELM and MLP with a classification accuracy of 97.9%, while ELM and MLP achieved classification accuracies of 69.80% and 87.06%, respectively.

The other is the lack of simulation of vertical urban landscape dynamics at the parcel level. Hence, this study should be the first to propose a comprehensive VCA framework for modeling horizontal and vertical multi-type urban landscape dynamics (HV-MVCA) at the parcel level. The HV-MVCA consists of two modules: a deep learning-based horizontal urban landscape dynamic simulation module and a random forest-based (RF) vertical metrics prediction module. Compared with traditional VCA, the HV-MVCA can obtain the highest simulation accuracy with an enhancement of 1.45%-4.56%. The RF-based fitting model can reasonably interpret the vertical metric as the coefficient of determination and the mean absolute percentage error was 0.88 and 28.93%. By localizing shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), the horizontal and vertical urban landscape dynamics in the future can be simulated under different scenarios.

Urban development and expansion have subjected PAs to significant pressure, as they are rapidly approaching. However, our understanding of the interaction between urban development and PAs in China when urbanization accelerated from 2000 to 2018 remains limited. To address this gap, we have realized the dynamic mapping of China's urban expansion and proposed the urban footprint intensity index (UFI) and PAs' UFI (PUFI) to quantify the spatial distribution of urban development and its potential pressure on PAs. Using the Generalized linear mixed-effects models, we also investigated how PAs limit the increase in UFI from multiple perspectives. Our results reveal that while China's urban areas continue to expand annually by 6101.3 km2, the distance between the protected area (PA) and the urban area is shrinking at a rate of 1.39 km per year, maintaining a logarithmic form. The PAs in the eastern China and the southern China always have higher PUFI values from 2000 to 2018. By contrast, those in the northern and western China have lower PUFI values in 2000, which increase dramatically by 2018. Across our study area, PAs have effectively acted as barriers to urban development, resisting a substantial 33.8% increase in UFI within their boundaries. Location and initial urban development conditions surrounding PAs are critical factors impacting their effectiveness in resisting urban development. These findings offer valuable insights for future assessments of the effectiveness of PAs in resisting urbanization on a global scale. Moreover, this study provide crucial guidance for fostering urban development along more sustainable trajectories, thereby ensuring the long-term conservation of PAs worldwide.","2023-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","103079","","","159","","Applied Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Effectiveness; Protected areas; Spatial distance; Urban expansion; Urban footprint intensity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is practically essential to optimize the sampling locations using limited sampling numbers to obtain the most comprehensive water quality monitoring results considering both the spatial and temporal dynamics. Existing sampling methods were restricted due to lacking pre-information and specific sampling objective function. This paper proposed an optimal sampling strategy using remote sensing (RS) big data and spatial sampling annealing (SSA) integrated approach for sampling design. The proposed method involved spatial-temporal clustering of the total suspended sediment (TSS) using long-term remote sensing data (Terra/Aqua MODIS, 2000–2014), determining the required sampling numbers using geostatistical analysis, and SSA simulation following the objective function of minimization of the spatial-temporal mean estimation error using remote sensing data as references. Taking total suspended sediment (TSS) observations at Poyang Lake, China, as the case study and application region. Results showed that the RS + SSA sampling approach is superior to conventional sampling methods such as systematic, stratified, and expert sampling, concerning spatial and temporal sampling accuracy. TSS estimation errors of the whole lake were reduced by 18.11% and 29.34% on average when compared to systematic and stratified sampling under the same sample size. The annual TSS estimation errors were dropped by approximately 50%. The sampling accuracy was affected by the synthetic effects of sampling strategy (station numbers and spatial distributions) and water quality variations (coefficient of variation, CV). Sampling optimization is more efficient to improve the sampling accuracy than increasing sampling size, which requires more cost and human resources. Remote sensing showed great potential as ideal means to provide spatially contiguous and comprehensive data as prior-knowledge for efficient sampling design. This paper provides solutions and recommendations for evaluating existing monitoring stations in their representation of water quality or optimizing a new sampling network for future implications of more efficient and precise water quality sampling and routine monitoring.","2021-07-10","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","146113","","","777","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Poyang Lake; Remote sensing; Sampling method; Spatial sampling annealing; Water quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dynamics of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems depend on processes like photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition and combustion, anthropogenic activities like emission of greenhouse gases and climatic variations in rainfall and temperature, and is stored as biomass in different forms. The quantification of biomass is necessary to understand the productivity of forests, carbon sink and source dynamics and recommend ways to aid sequestration through supply side interventions like afforestation and demand side measures that check wood consumption. In this study, carbon sequestration based on the change in total carbon in two different scenarios using Markov chain and InVEST model is evaluated for the years 2000, 2018 and predicted for 2035. The results show that 1.351 Tg carbon has already been lost from 2000 to 2018 in the forest area of Sariska Tiger Reserve and another 0.107 Tg of carbon is expected to be lost in the predicted future, when we compare the land use land cover of the year 2035 with the present scenario. The local communities extract fuelwood by cutting down tree branches illegally, which leads to carbon loss into the atmosphere. The lower release of carbon in 2035 as compared to 2018 is because of forest management practices e.g., plantations done in the range Tehla-Talabberi, Sariska- Ganeshpura, Alwar buffer-Shoydanpura, Talvriksh-Manavaas, Akbarpur-Kalikhol, Ajabgarh-Jatwana. The study shows that the economic value of carbon lost from 2000 to 2018 is million $ 214.57 and if we see the economic value of the predicted year 2035, carbon sequestration is worth million $ 17.19.

However, the main challenge to mapping human activities in cities using such NTL satellite sensor images is their coarse spatial resolution.

However, common approaches for spatial downscaling employ spatially stationary models that may not be optimal where the data are spatially heterogeneous. In this research, a geostatistical model termed Random Forest area-to-point regression Kriging (RFATPK) was employed to disaggregate coarse spatial scale VIIRS NTL images (450 m) to a fine spatial scale (100 m). The RF predicts at a coarse resolution from fine spatial resolution variables, such as a Population raster. ATPK then downscales the coarse residuals from the RF prediction. In numerical experiments, RFATPK was compared with three benchmark techniques, including the simple Allocation of pixel values from the coarse resolution NTL data, Machine Learning with Splines and Geographically Weighted Regression. The downscaled results were validated using fine resolution LuoJia 1-01 satellite sensor imagery. RFATPK produced more accurate disaggregated images than the three benchmark approaches, with mean root mean square errors (RMSE) for the year 2018 of 13.89 and 6.74 nWcm−2 sr−1, for Mumbai and New Delhi, respectively. Also, the property of perfect coherence, measured by the Correlation Coefficient, was preserved consistently when applying RFATPK and was almost 1 for all years. The applicability of the disaggregated NTL data to monitor socioeconomic activities at the within-city scale against the reference NTL was illustrated by utilizing them as a proxy for the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita and the Night Light Development Index. The GNI estimation from the downscaled NTL outperformed the coarse resolution NTL when examining their coefficients of determination, with R2 of 0.67 and 0.47 for the GNI estimation using the fine and coarse resolution NTL data, respectively. For the Night Light Development Index (NLDI), the results of the index were compared by measuring their correlation with the Human Development Index (HDI). The NLDI from the downscaled NTL outperformed the coarse resolution NTL when measuring the correlation with the HDI, with Pearson’s correlation coefficients of −0.48 and −0.35 for the NLDI using the fine and coarse resolution NTL data, respectively, for New Delhi. The outcomes indicate that RFATPK provides more accurate predictions than the three benchmark techniques and the downscaled NTL data are more suitable for fine scale socioeconomic applications, as demonstrated by the NLDI and GNI. This research, thus, shows that the RFATPK solution for NTL disaggregation can facilitate data enhancement for fine-scale sub-national applications in social sciences and can be generalized worldwide by including other cities as well as other applications.","2023-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","103395","","","122","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Area-to-point Kriging; Downscaling; Random forest regression; Satellite night-time lights; Socioeconomic applications; Spatial non-stationarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Groundwater mapping is essential to counter the excessive withdrawal of groundwater and fulfil the need of drinking, irrigation water in hard rock areas. Currently, the main problem is facing the groundwater level is decreasing due to less rainfall, climate changes and increasing demand, which is under in the hot zones. This results can be more useful for future challenges, sustainable development and demand to Jakham river basin. The main objective of this paper to demarcated the groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) using geospatial techniques for the hard rock region with the reference of aquifer parameters. In this paper, we have used to total eight thematic layers such as geomorphology, land use, soil, topographic elevation, slope, post-monsoon groundwater level (GWL), net recharge, and transmissivity, which are prepared from satellite data and field verification. All thematic layers were integrated for assigning the weights to demarcation of the groundwater potential zones in the RS and GIS environment. The selected thematic layers and features were assigned weightage and normalized by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique. Finally, the thematic layers were systematically integrated using weighted overlay analysis within a GIS environment. We have classified into five GWPZ classes i.e. very high, high, moderate, low, and very low for basin area using GIS, and AHP methods. The study area result indicated that high and moderate zone, which is confined in the central part of the basin, covers 2.43 % and 43.88 % area, respectively. The low (49.21 %) and very low (4.25%) GW potential zone is under the confined aquifer in the high slope and rock outcrops formations near the basin boundary. The final GWPZ map was validated with groundwater level fluctuation data, which illustrates the accuracy of the adopted approach. This unique approach and conclusions of this work may also help to develop the framework and policies for swiftly analyzing groundwater recharge planning, development and locating the artificial recharge structures in the other semi-arid, arid and hard rock regions.","2023-03-15","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","2892-2908","","6","71","","Advances in Space Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AHP; Geospatial technique; GIS; Groundwater; Potential zones; Semi-arid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, many global or regional land cover products are regularly released to the scientific community. Yet, the remote sensing community has not fully addressed the challenge to extract useful information from vast volumes of satellite data. Especially, major limitations concern the use of inadequate classification schemes and “black box” methods that may not match with end-users conceptualization of geographic features. In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-driven methodological approach to automatically process Sentinel-2 time series in order to produce pre-classifications that can be adapted by end-users to match their requirements. The approach relies on a conceptual framework inspired from ontologies of scientific observation and geographic information to describe the representation of geographic entities in remote sensing images. The implementation consists in a three-stage classification system including an initial stage, a dichotomous stage and a modular stage. At each stage, the system firstly relies on natural language semantic descriptions of time series of spectral signatures before assigning labels of land cover classes. The implementation was tested on 75 time series of Sentinel-2 images (i.e. 2069 images) in the Southern Brazilian Amazon to map natural vegetation and water bodies as required by a local end-user, i.e. a non-governmental organization. The results confirmed the potential of the method to accurately detect water bodies (F-score = 0.874 for bodies larger than 10 m) and map natural vegetation (max F-score = 0.875), yet emphasizing the spatial heterogeneity of accuracy results. In addition, it proved to be efficient to provide rapid estimates of degraded riparian forests at watershed level (R2 = 0.871). Finally, we discuss potential improvements both in the system's implementation, e.g. considering additional characteristics, and in the conceptual framework, e.g. moving from pixel- to object-based image analysis and evolving towards a hybrid system combining data- and knowledge-driven approaches.","2021-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","112615","","","264","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Amazon; Knowledge-driven; Land cover; Ontologies; Sentinel-2; Time series","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The agenda must include (1) development of methods that make sense of all real-world data (not selective input data for a physical model), (2) offering insights of significant value to critical real-world decisions for current or future practice (not decisions for an ideal world or decisions of minor concern to geotechnical engineers), and (3) sensitivity to the physical context of geotechnics (not abstract data-driven analysis connected to geotechnics in a peripheral way, i.e., engagement with the knowledge and experience base should be substantial). These three elements are termed “data centricity”, “fit for (and transform) practice”, and “geotechnical context” in the agenda. Given that a knowledge of the site is central to any geotechnical engineering project, data-driven site characterization (DDSC) must constitute one key application domain in data-centric geotechnics, although other infrastructure lifecycle phases such as project conceptualization, design, construction, operation, and decommission/reuse would benefit from data-informed decision support as well. One part of DDSC that addresses numerical soil data in a site investigation report and soil property databases is pursued under Project DeepGeo. In principle, the source of data can also go beyond site investigation, and the type of data can go beyond numbers, such as categorical data, text, audios, images, videos, and expert opinion. The purpose of Project DeepGeo is to produce a 3D stratigraphic map of the subsurface volume below a full-scale project site and to estimate relevant engineering properties at each spatial point based on actual site investigation data and other relevant Big Indirect Data (BID). Uncertainty quantification is necessary, as current real-world data is insufficient, incomplete, and/or not directly relevant to construct a deterministic map. The value of a deterministic map for decision support is debatable. The computational cost to do this for a 3D true scale subsurface volume must be reasonable. Ultimately, geotechnical structures need to be a part of a completely smart infrastructure that fits the circular economy and need to focus on delivering service to end-users and the community from project conceptualization to decommission/reuse with full integration to smart city and smart society. Although current geotechnical practice has been very successful in taking “calculated risk” informed by limited data, imperfect theories, prototype testing, observations, among others and exercising judicious caution and engineering judgment, there is no clear pathway forward to leverage on big data and digital technologies such as machine learning, BIM, and digital twin to meet more challenging needs such as sustainability and resilience engineering.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","967-989","","6","7","","Underground Space","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bayesian machine learning; Data-centric geotechnics; Data-driven site characterization (DDSC); Data-informed decision support index; Project DeepGeo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, land cover fraction mapping enables expressing the proportion of each pure class in each pixel, which increases precision and reduces legend complexity. To map land cover fractions, regression rather than classification algorithms are needed, and multiple approaches are available for this task. A major challenge for land cover fraction mapping models is data sparsity. Land cover fraction data is by its nature zero-inflated due to how common the 0% fraction is. As regression favours the mean, 0% and 100% fractions are difficult for regression models to predict accurately. We proposed a new solution by combining three models: a binary model determines whether a pixel is pure; if so, it is processed using a classification model; otherwise with a regression model. We compared multiple regression algorithms and implemented our proposed three-step model on the algorithm with the lowest RMSE. We further evaluated the spatial and per-class accuracy of the model and demonstrated a wall-to-wall prediction of seven land cover fractions over the globe. The models were trained on over 138,000 points and validated on a separate dataset of over 20,000 points, provided by the CGLS-LC100 project. Both datasets are global and aligned with the PROBA-V 100 m UTM grid. Results showed that the random forest regression model reached the lowest RMSE of 17.3%. Lowest MAE (7.9%) and highest overall accuracy (72% ± 2%) was achieved using random forest with our proposed three-model approach and median vote. This research proves that machine learning algorithms can be applied globally to map a wide variety of land cover fractions. Fraction mapping expresses land cover more precisely, and empowers users to create their own discrete maps using user-defined thresholds and rules, which enables customising the result for a diverse range of uses. The three-step approach is useful for addressing the zero-inflation issue and mapping 0% and 100% fractions more accurately, and thus has already been taken up in the operational production of global land cover fraction layers within the CGLS-LC100 project. Furthermore, this study contributes to the accuracy assessment of land cover fraction maps both thematically and spatially, and these methods could be taken up by future land cover fraction mapping efforts.","2021-06-15","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","112409","","","259","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cubist; Global land cover mapping; Land cover fraction mapping; Machine learning; Neural network; PROBA-V; Random forest; Spatial accuracy; Support vector regression; Time series analysis; Zero inflation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The regulation of soil acidity and alkalinity requires a clear understanding of soil pH variability and its influencing factors under regional land use change. This study explored the patterns of soil pH variability under land use change between 1984 and 2018 in a red soil hilly region (Xunwu County, Jiangxi Province) in southern China. We identified the key factors influencing regional spatiotemporal variability in soil pH and analyzed the response of soil pH variability to land use change. The results showed that the mean pH values of surface soil samples in 1984 (n = 595) and 2018 (n = 580) were 5.35 and 5.05, respectively. The soil pH change between the two periods ranged from −0.91 to 0.32, with a mean value of −0.30. In total, 91.72% of the study area showed an acidification trend from 1984 to 2018. The spatiotemporal variability in soil pH was influenced by elevation, slope, distance to rivers, changes in distance to roads, and changes in the nitrogen fertilizer application rate. The main land use conversion modes were cropland and forest transferred to garden and other land. The soil pH decreased in 15 of 16 conversion modes of cropland land, garden, forest, and other land, whereas a pH increase of 0.32 occurred under conversion from cropland to garden. Changes in distance to roads, changes in the nitrogen fertilizer application rate, and slope played a dominant role in soil pH variability under land use change. This study provides fundamental data for the formulation of soil acidity and alkalinity control measures, which in turn contributes to regional improvement of agricultural production stability and sustainable development.","2022-05-01","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:23:26","","106074","","","212","","CATENA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Geographically weighted regression; Human activities; Land use change; Natural conditions; pH variability; Soil acidification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LST values were retrieved from Landsat 8 data, and urban features were constructed using digital surface models, building footprints, and satellite imagery. Model-agnostic approaches were adopted to analyze the impacts of urban characteristics on LST. The boosted regression tree (BRT) model was used to capture the nonlinear effects of six most important factors on LST changes. The dominant influencing factors of LST were normalized difference built-up index, albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index. Building roofs, roads, and other hardscapes with high-albedo materials are preferred in alleviating surface urban heat island effect in Dhaka and Kolkata. The placement of urban parks with woody vegetation in an area larger than 0.6 ha produced effective cooling effect. In Chennai and Kolkata, urban policies to increase sky view factor are recommended.

The high demand for the mineral resources necessary for the transition to a carbon neutral and circular economy conflicts with the increasing difficulties of finding new deposits. As the sector heads towards embracing circularity and reducing the environmental impacts, a clear focus has been set on developing appropriate tools to boost the efficiency of mineral resource management, both technologically and economically. In this scenario, the Sentinel satellites of the European Copernicus program come into play. Despite being satellites considered medium resolution, they provide great temporal and spatial coverage in a continuous record, which makes them tools with great potential for the raw materials sector. However, the lack of applications in the raw materials sector suggests that these technological advances have remained underrated by sectoral actors. The RawMatCop program was designed to bridge this gap. This program, co-funded by the European Commission and EIT RawMaterials, aims to develop applications and promote the use of Copernicus data in the raw materials sector to contribute to a safe and sustainable supply of mineral resources. The presented applications can be grouped into three categories covering the whole mining cycle from exploration to exploitation and post-mining. Two of the presented case studies cover the study of primary sources including exploration of Iron Oxide Copper Gold mineralisations to identify high-potential mining areas and mapping of informal gold mining and its environmental impacts. Another project focused on secondary sources tackled data applications for grade mapping and sample optimisation in mining residues. And the forth project focused on monitoring ground stability related to mining activity. The results demonstrate the high cost-effectiveness of Sentinel 1 and 2 in extending ground-based measurements to larger areas, especially when these are hard-to-reach areas. Finally, the presented projects examine the industrial and social impacts of technological innovations, as well as contribute to the achievement of prominent European Union policy objectives and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.","2021-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:27","2024-01-19 10:23:27","","102384","","","74","","Resources Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Copernicus; Critical raw materials; Exploration; Ground instability; Mineral resources; Mining residuals; Sentinel; Small-scale mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This tree species is known as a source of income for local people via preparing medicine, food, industrial oil, livestock feed, and an effective role in water and soil conservation. In recent years, the reduction of M. peregrina has damaged ecosystem services in south-eastern Iran. According, the main objective of this study is to use new Machine Learning (ML) models include: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to predict the regions susceptible to M. peregrine recovery. South Baluchistan in Iran was selected as a study area due to its location in a represent amen region where sustainable environmental production is threatened by land degradation processes. The location of 83-plant mass of M. peregrina was recorded in field visits by a global positioning system (GPS) device to recognize the relationship between them and thirteen meteorological, morphometric, and geological indicators. Within the 83 selected sites, 70% of them were used for training and 30% used for ML models calibration to predict the susceptible growth regions of M. peregrina to determine the most important indicators affecting his presence and to determine the prediction accuracy for ML models, the Jackknife test method and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were used, respectively. The results showed that rainfall was the key indicator that determines the success of the plant establishment. So that, it had the most value of the percentage of relative decrease (PRD) as the following was 20.68, 30, 24.52, and 14 for the SVM, MDA, RF, and CART models, respectively.

The Amudarya River delta (AD) is highly vulnerable to land degradation. In this research, NDVI and albedo, which represent vegetation and soil conditions, were applied in change vector analysis (CVA) to monitor land degradation. The vegetation degradation and soil exposure characteristics of land degradation were considered. Furthermore, based on boosted regression trees (BRTs), eight potential driving factors (precipitation, temperature, drought, water withdrawal, canal, livestock, salt discharge and population) were chosen to explore their relative importance to land degradation. The results revealed that some land areas have gradually degraded and fell into high land degradation in the AD, especially in the downstream areas near the Aral Sea. Soil salinization is a major consequence of high land degradation in this region. Subsequently, 920.75 km2 and 183.10 km2 of abandoned croplands were converted to sparse vegetation and grasslands, respectively. The BRT model indicated that water withdrawal availability and decreased precipitation were the most influential factors explaining the land degradation of croplands and natural vegetation from 1990 to 2000, respectively. In contrast, the salt discharge to the field plot was a major force causing land degradation of different vegetation types in the subsequent time interval (2000–2015). Because an increase in the groundwater level resulted in secondary soil salinization, a large proportion (45%) of the increased salinization occurred during this time period. Notably, due to the accelerated shrinking of the Aral Sea, some land areas surrounding the sea have fallen into high land degradation.

However, the question keeps considering which tool can be used to examine UMC performance, whereas it requires experience. Therefore, this study aims to highlight the guidance of UMC-based models and their possibilities, insights, and opportunities. A bibliometric analysis is conducted based on database development from 1991 to 2022 and both Biblioshiny and VOSviewer tools. The evolution of the yearly publications and prominent bibliometric analyses are explored. The results reveal the continuous evolution of UMC-based models and hotspots related to “urban morphology”, and “vegetation” keywords.

Further efforts are needed to develop “UMC modeling” and its associated opportunities related to application fields, in the context of “optimization”, “data-driven”, and “coupled models”, which present trending up and a significant paradigm shift toward UMC performance. Moreover, the proposed matrix provides UMC-based models, and their classifications to outline their possibilities, insights, and opportunities. Such comprehensive results can provide multi-scale opportunities to develop UMC-based models and their application fields, which serves as research guidance to not only select but also develop appropriate and innovative tools or coupled tools associated with UMC performance in response to associated UMC challenges.","2023-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:27","2024-01-19 10:23:27","","113307","","","181","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Coupled models; Data-driven models; Numerical methods; Simulation-based models; UMC performance; Urban microclimate (UMC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data-driven models that investigate the feasibility of solar-fueled energies, face challenges in respect to identifying their appropriate input data as such variables may not be available at all sites due to a lack of environmental monitoring system. In this paper, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite-derived predictors are employed to train three-phase hybrid SVR model for monthly GSR prediction. Firstly, to acquire relevant model input features, MODIS variables are screened with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, and secondly, a Gaussian emulation method of sensitivity analysis is incorporated on all screened variables to ascertain their relative role in predicting GSR. To address pertinent issues of non-stationarities, PSO selected variables are decomposed with Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transformation prior to its incorporation in Support Vector Regression (SVR), constructing a three-phase PSO-W-SVR hybrid model where the hyper-parameters are acquired by evolutionary (i.e., PSO & Genetic Algorithm) and Grid Search methods. Three-phase PSO-W-SVR hybrid model is benchmarked with alternative machine learning models. Thirty-nine model scenarios are formulated: 13 without feature selection (e.g., SVR), 13 with feature selection (e.g., PSO-SVR for two-phase models) and the remainder 13 with feature selection strategy coupled with data decomposition algorithm (e.g., PSO-W-SVR leading to a three-phase model). Metrics such as skill score (RMSESS), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott’s (WI), Legates & McCabe’s (E1) and Nash–Sutcliffe coefficients (ENS) are applied to comprehensively evaluate prescribed models. Empirical results register high performance of three-phase hybrid PSO-W-SVR models, exceeding the prescribed alternative models. High predictive ability evidenced by a low RRMSE and high E1 ascertains PSO-W-SVR hybrid model as considerably favorable in its capability to be enriched by MODIS satellite-derived variables. Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform algorithm is also seen to provide resolved patterns in satellite variables, leading to a superior performance compared to the other data-driven model. The research avers that a three-phase hybrid PSO-W-SVR model can be a viable tool to predict GSR using satellite derived data as predictors, and is particularly useful for exploration of renewable energies where satellite footprint are present but regular environmental monitoring systems may be absent.","2019-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:27","2024-01-19 10:23:27","","109247","","","113","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hybrid energy prediction model; Maximum overlap discrete wavelet; MODIS satellite; Remote sensing; Renewable energy exploration; Support vector regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, the Global Human Settlement Layer GHS-BUILT-S2 product reports the probability of the presence of built-up areas in 2018 in a global 10 m × 10 m grid. However, practitioners typically require interpretable measures such as binary surfaces indicating the presence or absence of built-up areas or estimates of sub-pixel built-up surface fractions. Herein, we assess the relationship between the built-up probability in GHS-BUILT-S2 and reference built-up surface fractions derived from a highly reliable reference database for several regions in the United States. Furthermore, we identify a binarization threshold using an agreement maximization method that creates binary built-up land data from these built-up probabilities. These binary surfaces are input to a spatially explicit, scale-sensitive accuracy assessment which includes the use of a novel, visual-analytical tool which we call focal precision-recall signature plots. Our analysis reveals that a threshold of 0.5 applied to GHS-BUILT-S2 maximizes the agreement with binarized built-up land data derived from the reference built-up area fraction. We find high levels of accuracy (i.e., county-level F-1 scores of almost 0.8 on average) in the derived built-up areas, and consistently high accuracy along the rural–urban gradient in our study area.

These approaches are relevant to soil properties, meteorological conditions, management practices, and crop in-season growing status. This study aims to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to incorporate the above variables as well as the field reactive nitrogen (N) losses (i.e., N damage cost) simulated by a DeNitrification–DeComposition (DNDC) model to develop a new strategy for optimizing rice in-season topdressing N (TN) usage. Rice field experiments with multiple N treatments and rice varieties were carried out during 2015–2021 at four study sites in eastern China. Four ML algorithms, namely random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), lasso regression (LSR), and partial least square regression (PLSR) were used to develop in-season prediction models of yield and reactive N losses by combining soil, meteorological, and management data with crop remote sensing data. The observed in-season agronomic optimum N rates (AONR) that can maximize rice yield at different sites were in the range of 116.5 to 177.4 kg N ha−1, while the in-season economic optimum N rates (EONR) that can maximize marginal revenue (i.e., yield income minus N fertilizer costs and N damage costs) were in the range of 97.4 to 163.6 kg N ha−1. The developed ML models were further used to simulate yield and marginal revenue responses to a series of assumed TN rates (0–300 kg N ha−1, gradient = 20 kg N ha−1). Comparably, RFR model and SVR model were more suitable for determining optimum TN rates, because their simulated response curves of yield and marginal revenue fit the normal regulation (linear plus plateau or single-peak shapes). Independent validation results showed that the in-season AONR and EONR predicted by RFR and SVR well accorded with the observed values (R2 ≥ 0.64, RRMSE ≤ 18.3 %), and the accuracy of ML models containing both historical and in-season meteorological information is superior to ML models that contain in-season meteorological information only. The proposed ML-based strategy is expected to help the regional rice production systems precisely manage N use, improve net profits, and reduce environmental footprints.","2023-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:27","2024-01-19 10:23:27","","107858","","","209","","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural sustainability; DeNitrification–DeComposition model; Machine learning; N damage cost; Nitrogen topdressing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, further renewable additions must be supported by battery-energy storage systems (BESS) to meet the grid ramping requirements. BESS being quite expensive and require heavy maintenance, municipal solid waste-based waste-to-energy (WtE) plants play a crucial role in enhancing grid reliability under a high renewable energy (RE) environment. In this paper, the potential of four renewable energy technologies, such as floating solar, bifacial rooftop, wind energy conversion system, and WtE plant, are evaluated for a smart city, Visakhapatnam, India.

The results show that for an optimal set of BESS and hybrid renewable energy sources (HRES), the grid can offer better reliability with the presence of the WtE plant. The obtained optimal configuration results in a levelized cost of US $ 0.0539, high reliability with a loss of power supply probability of 0.049%, and reduced battery degradation with minimal life cycle loss of 0.048.

Besides increasing biotic pressure, land cover change, precipitation variability, and climate water deficits have a high potential to render the exploitation of resources unsustainable. This study is on the urgent basis addressing the sensitivity, fragility, and vulnerability status for rangeland ecosystem conservation management practices. Based on 17 distinct environmental indicators under five themes: topography, geo-climatic, socio-economic, ecological, and edaphic, which measure their susceptibility. Then, they evaluate their characteristics and sensitivity responses, as well as the resilience capabilities of the areas, utilizing the integrative methodology of the E-PSR (Ecosystem – Pressure, Sensitivity, and Resilience) model using a weightage decision matrix geostatistical approach.

Nevertheless, the productivity of rice (3.36 t ha−1) is the lowest in South Asia region. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to employ a mixed-methods approach to characterize and decompose yield gaps (YGs) in the context of identifying sustainable intensification pathways for rice production in Nepal. METHODS Methodologies include: a) landscape-scale crop diagnostic survey on crop management, field attributes, and productivity outcomes combined with gridded soil and daily weather data to decompose rice yield gaps into constituent factors with machine learning diagnostics; b) with survey data, computation of key performance indicators to identify factors associated with productivity, profitability, and resource use efficiencies; c) complementary multi-location on-farm experiments (2011–2017) evaluating new agronomic management practices; and d) dynamic simulation (ORYZA3) to derive estimates of rice yield potential. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Analysis of survey data suggests an exploitable YG of 2.57 t ha−1 (40%) and the total YG of 4.85 t ha−1 (55%) indicating substantial scope for increasing rice yields in Nepal. Frequency of irrigation, amount of late-season rainfall, soil type, amount of early-season rainfall, presence of water stress, soil pH, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer rates are the principal determinants of productivity outcomes in descending ranked order. Efficiency metrics suggest rice farmers in the study region make good use of fertilizer inputs, but since application rates are very low (e.g. most farmers apply <20 kg P ha−1) unsustainable mining of soil nutrients is likely common. Farmers in the top 10% of the yield distribution had lower greenhouse gas emission intensities (−43%), increased water productivity (+66%), and higher use efficiencies of N and P fertilizers (+28% and + 20%, respectively), suggesting that yield intensification can be achieved without tradeoffs with key environmental performance indicators. On-farm experiments conducted over several seasons support insights from surveys by demonstrating that major gains in rice yield (1.86 t ha−1) and profitability (US$ 243 ha−1) are achievable through the adoption of good agronomic practices. SIGNIFICANCE Through a mixed methods approach, our results suggest that adoption of integrated 'good agronomic practices' can close YGs and improve food security outcomes associated with the rice-based agricultural systems of Nepal while simultaneously preserving or enhancing key sustainability and livelihood objectives.","2021-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:27","2024-01-19 10:23:27","","103182","","","192","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Good agronomic practices; Machine learning; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable intensification; Yield gap","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these studies underutilize the potential available data by focusing on a small set of predetermined indicators. In this study, we integrate these methods and bioinformatic approaches to fundamentally reframe how the complex natural and built environments are represented and evaluated. We demonstrate this integrated approach by assessing significant differences in attributes of the environment surrounding childcare facilities that reported high and low child development outcomes in South Africa. Using a cross-sectional study design, a standard geofence (1.6 km square) was applied to a set of GPS coordinates from N = 86 childcare facilities in South Africa reporting mean child development outcomes in the top and bottom 10% of all facilities surveyed (n = 43 each). GSV images in the geofenced site around the childcare facilities were downloaded via the GSV API. Next, Google's Vision API – a set of algorithms that can generate >10,000 unique labels – was applied to each image, generating a set of 30–50 labels describing features of each image with a minimum accuracy of 60%. Abundances of labels from each site hosting a childcare facility were estimated and normalized. Differences in the abundance values were compared between high and low scoring sites using bar plots, alpha and beta diversity, ordination plots, and Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe). The results suggested that higher abundances of labels associated with transportation and residential buildings or community spaces were present in high scoring sites, while in low scoring sites, labels associated with roads, dry and rural land, and electrical public utilities were significantly more abundant. This exploratory approach can provide a globally scalable method that can generate insights at a granular level for environmental effects on child health.","2023-04-01","2024-01-19 10:23:27","2024-01-19 10:23:27","","100950","","","30","","Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Child development; Environmental exposures; GSV images; Image classification; South Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These issues are mainly pronounced in the inland arid area. The ecological environment’s deterioration is especially severe in the drylands of the interior. However, dryland wetland changes and their response to climate are poorly understood. This study uses the K-means algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to classify two typical dryland wetlands (Ebinur and Bosten Lakes) for rapidly and accurately detecting dryland wetland changes. Moreover, it explores the long-term spatial–temporal variation in wetland distribution. In addition, it investigates the response of various lakes to climate change in northern and southern Xinjiang using wavelet analysis. The study’s results showed that K-means clustering in the GEE platform has a high classification accuracy (Kappa > 0.8) in wetland classification, making it a feasible approach. The terminal lake wetland types, represented by the Ebinur Lake, changed significantly between 2001 and 2021. In contrast, the inflow-outflow lake wetland types, represented by the Bosten Lake, perform more consistently. Significant spatial–temporal variation is observed at Ebinur Lake, with the lake gradually shrinking and transforming into a marsh, where the largest marsh proportion degrades into non-wetland during the year. Bosten Lake experienced frequent conversions between marsh and non-wetland throughout the year. Furthermore, the responses of various dryland lakes to climate change are consistent, and a low precedes precipitation and follows evapotranspiration. However, their sensitivity to climate response varies, with the terminal lake being most affected by climate change. Mastering the dynamic changes and climate response of dryland wetlands achieves the sustainable development goals of drylands, including carbon neutrality and peak carbon dioxide emissions.","2023-05-01","2024-01-19 10:23:27","2024-01-19 10:23:27","","110168","","","149","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Clustering algorithm; Delayed response; Dryland wetland; Wetland condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A dearth of national-scale assessments in the Global South has precluded the ability to explore how political regimes, such as the forced racial segregation in South Africa during and after Apartheid, have influenced the extent of and access to green infrastructure over time. We investigate whether there are disparities in green infrastructure distributions across race and income geographies in urban South Africa. Using open-source satellite imagery and geographic information, along with national census statistics, we find that public and private green infrastructure is more abundant, accessible, greener and more treed in high-income relative to low-income areas, and in areas where previously advantaged racial groups (i.e. White citizens) reside. Areas with White residents report 6-fold higher income, have 11.7% greater tree cover, 8.9% higher vegetation greenness and live 700 m closer to a public park than areas with predominantly Black African, Indian, and Coloured residents. The inequity in neighborhood greenness levels has been maintained (for Indian and Coloured areas) and further entrenched (for Black African areas) since the end of Apartheid in 1994 across the country. We also find that these spatial inequities are mirrored in both private (gardens) and public (street verges, parks, green belts) spaces, hinting at the failure of governance structures to plan for and implement urban greening initiatives. By leveraging open-access satellite data and methods presented here, there is scope for civil society to monitor urban green infrastructure over time and thereby hold governments accountable to addressing environmental justice imperatives in the future.

This study aims to model the Water Footprint (WF) by using the four kernels of Gaussian processes models (Polynomial, Normalized Poly, Radial Basis Function RBF, and Pearson Universal Function PUK) and select the best kernel with best climate scenario. This study investigates the predicting WF of maize based on meteorological variables including maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), mean temperature (Tmean), solar radiation (SR), wind speed (WS), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), Extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) relative humidity (RH) and crop coefficient (Kc) by applying ten scenarios of climate variables in the Egyptian Nile Delta, Ad Daqahliyah Governorate for predicting blue WF of maize during 2000–2019. The main findings are following as, firstly; based on developing four kernels, the performance of the PUK kernel in predicting blue WF is far better than the other three kernels followed by the Poly kernel. Secondly; for PUK kernel, model 7 (Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, WS, Sunshine Hours (SH), VPD and SR) has good performance which is close to models 8 (model 7 +Ra), model 9 (model 7 +Ra and RH) and model 10 (all inputs). Thirdly; in all four kernels, the error rate in small blue WF values is higher than the other values, moreover, the error value decreases at the medium blue WF values, while, it increases again at large WF values. Therefore, the developed models in this study can help and promote the decision makers to manage and secure the water resources management under the extreme climate events.","2021-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:27","2024-01-19 10:23:27","","107052","","","255","","Agricultural Water Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Blue water footprint; CROPWAT; Gaussian processes; Machine learning; Maize; PUK kernel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Secondly, current literature uses low-level semantic scene image class definitions, which may not have many relevant applications in certain domains. To examine these problems, we applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to high-level scene image classification for identifying patterns in urban housing density in a developing country setting. An end-to-end model training workflow is proposed for this purpose. A method for quantifying spatial extent of urban housing classes which gives insight into settlement patterns is also proposed. The method consists of computing the ratio between area covered by a given housing class and total area occupied by all classes. In the current work this method is implemented based on grid count, whereby the number of predicted grids for one housing class is divided by the total grid count for all classes. Results from the proposed method were validated against building density data computed on OpenStreetMap data. Our results for scene image classification are comparable to current state-of-the-art, despite focusing only on most difficult classes in those works. We also contribute a new satellite scene image data set that captures some general characteristics of urban housing in developing countries.

The UN’s Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goal number 8, section 8.7 specifically refers to the issue of forced labour: ending modern slavery and human trafficking, including child labour, in all forms by 2025. Although there is a global political commitment to ending slavery, one of the biggest barriers to doing so is having reliable and timely, spatially explicit and scalable data on slavery activity. The lack of these data compromises evidence-based action and policy formulation. Thus, to meet the challenge of ending modern slavery new and innovative approaches, with an emphasis on efficient use of resources (including financial) are needed. This paper demonstrates the fundamental role of remote sensing as a source of evidence. We provide an estimate of the number of brick kilns across the ‘Brick Belt’ that runs across south Asia. This is important because these brick kilns are known sites of modern-day slavery. This paper reports the first rigorous estimate of the number of brick kilns present and does so using a robust method that can be easily adopted by key agencies for evidence-based action (i.e. NGOs, etc.) and is based on freely available and accessible remotely sensed data. From this estimate we can not only calculate the scale of the slavery problem in the Brick Belt, but also calculate the impact of slavery beyond that of the enslaved people themselves, on, for example, environmental change and impacts on ecosystem services – this links to other Sustainable Development Goals. As the process of achieving key Sustainable Development Goal targets will show, there are global benefits to ending slavery - this will mean a better world for everyone: safer, greener, more prosperous, and more equal.

In this study, first, the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of the regional CP and LD in the Yangtze River Delta from 2003 to 2017 were analyzed. Then, the coupling coordination model and kernel density estimation method were used to reveal their coupling characteristics. Finally, two types of Markov transition matrices were constructed to empirically analyze the dynamic change rule of their coordinated development, and their long-term evolution trends were simulated under different neighborhood characteristics. The results revealed that the CP initially decreased and then rapidly increased from 2003 to 2017, while the LD continuously decreased from 13.2 thousand people/km2 in 2003 to 10.9 thousand people/km2 in 2017. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) between the CP and LD exhibited a two-stage decline, followed by a rise over the past 15 years, with the CCD level shifting downward in 19.68% of the counties and upward in 19.05% of the counties. The transition of the CCD level had a significant spatial spillover effect. If adjacent to counties with a low CCD for a long period of time, the proportion of the counties with a low CCD would increase to 61.65%, while long-term neighboring counties with a high CCD would eventually stabilize the percentage of counties with a high CCD at 61.83%.

This research aimed to assess the consistency of Sentinel-2 images for benthic habitat mapping in the waters of Labuan Bajo, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. We employed two approaches: 1) assessing the consistency of Sentinel-2 image used to map four classes of benthic habitat from 2017 to 2019 and 2) an in-depth analysis of three images in May 2019 to assess the consistency of four-class benthic habitat mapping (coral reef, seagrass, macroalgae and bare substratum). This research incorporated atmospheric, sunglint and water column corrections and four classification algorithms: Isodata, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Maximum Likelihood. The consistency of Sentinel-2 images was assessed using overall accuracy (OA), agreement percentage (AP) and total classification performance (TCP). Our results indicate that Sentinel-2 images are reliable enough for accurate benthic habitat mapping with OA >80% and consistent with agreement >80% in both approaches given the right image conditions, which are minimum cloud cover, haze, and sunglint. These factors strongly contribute to the consistency of the resulting benthic habitat classification from the Sentinel-2 images. Also, to maximize the rich image availability in the Sentinel-2 archive database, we suggest selecting images with minimal atmospheric and sunglint disturbances instead of performing image corrections that may introduce noise, leading to lower accuracy and consistency. Finally, we encourage the use of Sentinel-2 images in benthic habitat monitoring since the long-term plan of the Sentinel-2 mission guarantees the availability of these datasets.","2021-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:28","2024-01-19 10:23:28","","100572","","","23","","Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accuracy assessment; Benthic habitat; Image consistency; Mapping; Sentinel-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we developed specific daytime and nighttime multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models to analyze and predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the Urban Heat Island intensity (UHII), using the air temperature (Tair) as the response variable. We profited from the wealth of in situ Tair data and a comprehensive pool of predictors variables — including land cover, population, traffic, urban geometry, weather data and atmospheric vertical indices. Cluster analysis divided the study period into three main groups, each dominated by a combination of weather systems that, in turn, influenced the onset and strength of the UHII. Anticyclonic circulations favored the emergence of the largest UHII (hourly mean of 5.06 °C), while cyclonic circulations dampened its development. The MLR models were only able to explain a modest percentage of variance (64 and 34% for daytime and nighttime, respectively), which we interpret as part of their inability to capture key factors controlling Tair. The RF models, on the other hand, performed considerably better, with explanatory power over 96% of the variance for daytime and nighttime conditions, capturing and mapping the fine-scale Tair spatiotemporal variability in both periods and under each cluster condition. The feature importance analysis showed that the meteorological variables and the land cover were the main predictors of the Tair.

In doing so, they follow an understanding that isolates technology from politics. While this division is still prevalent in international relations, recent scholarship has promoted the intricate relationship of technology with politics as socio-material. Adding to this literature, I draw on the sociology of expectations to propose an alternative reading of nongovernmental remote sensing. For this purpose, the notion of technopolitical barriers is introduced to trace controversies about technological expectations of satellite imagery. Based on expert interviews and document analysis, I identify three waves of enthusiasm, which are characterized by particularly salient expectations and techno-political barriers. The first wave is fueled by an enthusiasm about the general benefits of visual transparency as opposed to Cold War secrecy. The second wave turns toward nongovernmental imagery intelligence for human security. In the third wave, satellite imagery joins multiple data streams to support political and business decisions. Taken together, the three-wave model distorts the linear understanding of a revolutionary development but reveals the political and controversial nature of the ongoing commercialization of satellite imagery. As a part of this, nongovernmental remote sensing has experienced a focus shift from visual transparency toward geospatial big data. Moreover, the three-wave model highlights the persistence of expectations and techno-political barriers in the nongovernmental sector with important implications for policymaking and the global impact of commercial satellite imagery.","2019-02-01","2024-01-19 10:23:28","2024-01-19 10:23:28","","107-116","","","47","","Space Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Geospatial revolution; Global politics; Remote sensing; Sociology of expectations; Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data from 1,928 planted forests across China, we found that forestation has increasingly occurred on marginal land from 1980 to the 2010s. Due to less favorable climatic and soil conditions, marginal sites exhibited lower tree carbon accumulation (−847.7 g C m−2) and allocated more carbon to roots for accessing nutrients and water (+6.3% root:shoot ratio) compared with non-marginal sites.

Despite this Park's protection, illegal human activities threaten its vegetation, and little information about the on-site causes of degradation is available. Here we explored the extent and drivers of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) in the WNPB. For this purpose, we used Landsat (1988, 2001 and 2016), and ancillary data to determine the spatial structure and changes in LULC with a random forest classifier. We identified socio-economic factors influencing LULC by conducting household surveys, focus groups, and field observations. We used the ranking and binary logistic regression methods to analyze the socio-economic data. A logistic regression model assessed the relationship between land cover change and socio-economic factors. The results showed that multi-temporal classification performed significantly better than mono-temporal one in the study area. However, the combination of mono-temporal reflectances and vegetation indices for LULC classification significantly enhanced the accuracy to the level of multi-temporal classification. This result indicates that this combination is an efficient alternative to multi-temporal classification in the study area where cloud-free imagery is rare. In the WNPB, LULC dynamics from 1988 to 2001 was mainly characterized by reduction of tree savannas (9.4%) and woodland (8.8%) and expansion of bare soil (0.1%) and mixed vegetation (18.1%). From 2001 to 2016, croplands increased by 102.1%. Bush fire (77.19%), wood harvesting (48.25%), lack of rain (48.25%) and elephants’ impact (20.18%) were the leading direct causes of LULC change. In general, the perceptions of local populations about vegetation trends were in line with the observations from remote sensing. Altogether, the tree vegetation in the study area decreased significantly between 2001 and 2016, and the cause of this change appears to be unsustainable land-use rather than rainfall conditions. According to these findings, land-use management practices in this park should be more sustainable and provide education (and changing habits) to the surrounding population. It is therefore suggested that the government regulate illegal activities through forest law enforcement to protect the WNPB from over-exploitation.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:28","2024-01-19 10:23:28","","100768","","","44","","Environmental Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biodiversity; Change detection; GIS; Protected areas; Random forest; Remote sensing; SDGs; Vegetation; West Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurate delineation of coastal aquaculture extent and changes is thus significant for improving coastal zone management toward sustainability. Here, by means of Sentinel-2 images, we propose an effective and rapid approach that combines simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) with hierarchical decision trees (HDT), so-called SNIC-HDT, to generate fine-resolution coastal aquaculture pond data at the national scale of China. The SNIC-HDT fully considers the spatial heterogeneity of coastal aquaculture ponds and performs accurate segmentation by determining the optimal segmentation scale for coastal aquaculture ponds with different sizes and shapes. In addition, the SNIC-HDT incorporates temporal features into the establishment of HDT and thus effectively distinguishes coastal aquaculture ponds from other water bodies. In support of the Google Earth Engine platform, we employed 85,501 scenes of Sentinel-2 images and generated the first annual 10-m spatial resolution national coastal aquaculture pond dataset of China between 2016 and 2021 (China_CAP), with an overall classification accuracy of more than 90%. This dataset reveals that total area of China's coastal aquaculture ponds experienced a substantial loss of 13.21% from 9769 km2 in 2016 to 8629 km2 in 2021. The most remarkable areal reduction occurred in Zhejiang Province, with a decrease rate of 38.24%, followed by Guangdong (27.93%), and these reductions were mostly related to the policy of retuning aquaculture ponds to natural wetlands. Coastal aquaculture ponds in Fujian and Tianjin provinces experienced slight areal gains (7.24% and 2.13%). The results generated in this study could provide a basis for the conservation of habitats of migratory water birds on the East Asia-Australia Flyway and are of great scientific and practical importance to support the evaluation of Sustainable Development Goals.","2023-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:28","2024-01-19 10:23:28","","113347","","","284","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","China; Coastal aquaculture ponds; Coastal wetlands; Google Earth Engine; Sentinel-2 imagery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, this research aims to: (1) determine the optimal strategy for applying the SPM inversion model to various time series images, (2) explore the inversion mode of SPM under the missing-image scenario, and (3) analyze the spatiotemporal changes of SPM over the Ebinur Lake lake from May to October during the 2011–2020 period.

Thirdly, the SPM fluctuations varied significantly, and the SPM concentrations showed an increasing trend with a widening amplitude over time. The inter-annual SPM increasing trend was significant, while the inter-month SPM variations have not changed much. When compared to the lake's core area, the SPM concentrations in the nearshore area were noticeably higher, and this has been consistent over the years.

This study presents a novel two-stage data-driven framework combining a multivariate metric-distance analysis with machine learning (ML) techniques for resilience and livability assessment of smart cities. A longitudinal dataset for 35 top-ranked European smart cities from 2015 till 2020 applied as the case study under the proposed framework. Initially, a metric distance-based weighting approach is used to weight the indicators and quantify the scores across each aspect under city resilience and urban livability. The key aspects under city resilience include social, economic, infrastructure and built environment and, institutional resilience, while under urban livability, the aspects include accessibility, community well-being, and economic vibrancy. Fuzzy c-means clustering as an unsupervised machine learning technique is used to sort smart cities based on the degree of performance. In addition, an intelligent approach is presented for the prediction of the degree of livability, resilience, and aggregate performance of smart cities based on various supervised ML techniques. Classification models such as Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and, ensemble models including Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting machine (GBM) were used. Three coefficients (accuracy, Cohen's Kappa (κ) and average area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR)) along with confusion matrix were used to appraise the performance of the classifier ML models.

The supply of timely, relevant and reliable data is essential in guiding policies and decisions for successful implementation of the SDGs. Yet official statistics cannot provide all of the data needed to populate the SDG indicator framework. Citizen science offers a novel solution and an untapped opportunity to complement traditional sources of data, such as household surveys, for monitoring progress towards the SDGs, while at the same time mobilizing action and raising awareness for their achievement. This paper presents the potential offered by one specific citizen science tool, Picture Pile, to complement and enhance official statistics to monitor several SDGs and targets. Designed to be a generic and flexible tool, Picture Pile is a web-based and mobile application for ingesting imagery from satellites, orthophotos, unmanned aerial vehicles or geotagged photographs that can then be rapidly classified by volunteers. The results show that Picture Pile could contribute to the monitoring of fifteen SDG indicators under goals 1, 2, 11, 13, 14 and 15 based on the Picture Pile campaigns undertaken to date. Picture Pile could also be modified to support other SDGs and indicators in the areas of ecosystem health, eutrophication and built-up areas, among others. In order to leverage this particular tool for SDG monitoring, its potential must be showcased through the development of use cases in collaboration with governments, NSOs and relevant custodian agencies. Additionally, mutual trust needs to be built among key stakeholders to agree on common goals that would facilitate the use of Picture Pile or other citizen science tools and data for SDG monitoring and impact.","2022-02-01","2024-01-19 10:23:29","2024-01-19 10:23:29","","81-93","","","128","","Environmental Science & Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citizen science; Citizen science tools; Crowdsourcing; Earth Observation; SDG monitoring; SDGs; Sustainable Development Goals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we focused on a novel derivation of the Spectrum Based Learner (SBL) algorithm by i) taking into account both the geographical proximity and the spectral similarity in the computation of the distance between samples, and ii) using an optimal pair of spectral pre-treatments with the first used for the determination of neighbours while the latter for the estimation of the target property. The proposed approach was tested on a recently developed standardized Soil Spectral Library (SSL) across the VIS-NIR-SWIR spectral region range (350–2500 nm) which comprises 1760 soil samples from 9 different countries and is considered the largest and most diverse soil database infrastructure in the region compatible with other SSLs. Here, we found that our approach presents a great potential for predicting soil texture contents (Clay, Sand, and Silt), organic carbon (OC), Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), pH, and Electrical Conductivity (EC). These results outperform the predictive performance of other state of the art global and local approaches that have been applied to similar large and complex soil datasets. The use of geographical coordinates in the computation of the sample similarities enhanced the predictions of soil properties, since it allowed the generation of local subsets that present similar soil compositions. In addition, we conclude that the various spectral sources as derived by a set of predefined spectral pre-processing techniques contain complementary information which should be combined instead of relying solely on the best spectral pre-processing technique. This approach could be effectively utilized to enhance the predictions of soil properties in large and complex SSLs, since it decreased the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) by a relative mean of 6.47% (average value across the properties – decrease ranging from 2.90% to 9.09%) for the various soil properties, compared to other global and local algorithms. We conclude that national SSLs that were measured under a standardization process could further contribute to the global initiative to address challenges and support a data-centric approach for informed decision making with regards to environmental and agricultural issues.","2019-04-15","2024-01-19 10:23:29","2024-01-19 10:23:29","","11-24","","","340","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Local regression modelling; Memory-based learning; Regional in situ database; Soil spectral library; Spectrum based learner; VIS-NIR-SWIR spectroscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monitoring snow coverage is therefore crucial for both optimising the supply of snowpack-derived water and understanding how climate change could impact on this source, vital for sustaining human activities and the natural environment during the dry season. Mountainous sites can be characterised by complex morphologies, cloud cover and forests that can introduce errors into the estimates of snow cover obtained from remote sensing. Consequently, there is a need to develop simulation models capable of predicting how snow coverage evolves across a season. Cellular Automata models have previously been used to simulate snowmelt dynamics, but at a coarser scale that limits insight into the precise factors driving snowmelt at different stages. To address this information gap, we formulate a novel, fine-scale stochastic Cellular Automaton model that describes snow coverage across a high-elevation catchment. Exploiting its refinement, the model is used to explore the interplay between three factors proposed to play a critical role: terrain elevation, sun incidence angle, and the extent of nearby snow. We calibrate the model via a randomised parameter search, fitting simulation data against snow cover masks estimated from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Our analysis shows that:-The three simple assumptions are sufficient to yield a close correspondence between model output and the estimated snow cover masks.-Across the study area, elevation and neighbouring snow appear to be particularly influential, with incidence playing a relatively minor role for much of the process.-Incidence, though, plays a significant role early in the process, and allows the identification of regions that receive sufficient solar energy to trigger snowmelt.-Discrepancies between model output and satellite data indicate other potential factors at play, the identification of which will demand future attention.","2023-01-20","2024-01-19 10:23:29","2024-01-19 10:23:29","","159195","","","857","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cellular automaton model; High-elevation catchment; Mountain hydrology; Sentinel-2; Snow cover area","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Dongting Lake area in China, serving as a significant wetland nature reserve and grain production zone, is increasingly confronted with complex, interdependent trade-offs between agricultural cultivation and the ecological and environmental preservation of wetlands (SDG 2 and 15). To analyze the trade-off between conservation and food security, it is crucial to rely on long-term, continuous monitoring of land cover changes in the lake area. However, the absence of reliable optical remote sensing has posed a significant challenge due to the prevalence of cloudy and rainy conditions. Our study begins by integrating long-term Landsat and MODIS data using the GF-SG fusion algorithm to generate 8-day NDVI data with a spatial resolution of 30 m. This analysis focuses on the areas outside the embankment of Dongting Lake (referred to as O-DTL) from 2003 to 2020. We then employ a pixel-connected sample migration method to facilitate automated sampling of land cover types and a random forest classification algorithm to analyze long-term dynamic changes. Finally, by combining meteorological and social data, we examine the temporal patterns of land cover changes in the study area and identify the underlying factors influencing them. The results indicate a trade-off between the fluctuation of cropland and forest area from 2003 to 2020. Water body areas have exhibited a significant decrease, while impervious surface areas have consistently increased annually. Impervious surface areas have experienced a substantial increase of approximately 70%, with almost 90% of this expansion resulting from the conversion of cropland. Under the premise of maintaining a stable area for food cultivation, the land consumed by urban expansion eventually encroached on the wetland water bodies of the reserve. The reduction in wetland water area in the O-DTL can be primarily attributed to agricultural cultivation, while urban expansion and urbanization have indirectly contributed to the decrease. This study provides a case in which prioritizing food security (SDG 2) takes precedence over ecological conservation (SDG 15), highlighting its significant implications for guiding subsequent development in the Dongting Lake area. This finding is crucial for minimizing unintended consequences and maximizing co-benefits between sustainable development goals.","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:29","2024-01-19 10:23:29","","102338","","","78","","Ecological Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cropland; Land cover and change; Long-time series remote sensing data; Random forest model; SDGs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, planning assessments for this novel sustainable energy technology exposed knowledge gaps jeopardising global financial investments and regulatory approvals. Knowledge and methodological gaps cause inaccurate performance predictions in current geospatial-engineering modelling tools and fail to adequately quantify the diverse range of layered performance qualities and impacts of floating photovoltaics. This paper advances a geo-sensitive system dynamics framework to systemically integrate the energy, environmental and economic domain object functions in characterising the behaviour and sustainability of floating photovoltaic systems theoretically. The framework serves as computer logic in a geospatial digital twin to synthesise floatovoltaic operations to predict the technology’s sustainability impact and offset attributes in balanced scorecard metrics and water–energy–land–food nexus indicators. Experimental evaluations with the proposed framework in a real-world setting demonstrate the value of the holistically integrated framework in analytical floatovoltaic project appraisal and planning support. The results highlight significant advantages when comparing a 1000 m2 floatovoltaic system with a similar-sized conventional photovoltaic alternative, including a 19.3% lifetime energy gain, a carbon emission displacement of CO2e=5168t and a freshwater evaporation benefit of 983 kL. Predictive energy, environmental and economic modelling also offers water–energy–land–food–resource analysis parameters, thus delivering multi-attribute performance profiles that solve many of the current problems with the “technology unknowns” of floatovoltaics that impede energy project commissioning and licensing approvals.","2023-02-01","2024-01-19 10:23:29","2024-01-19 10:23:29","","102901","","","55","","Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Floating PV impact assessment; Floating solar simulation model; Floatovoltaic performance profiling; System dynamics sustainability; Theoretical characterisation of FPV; WELF nexus indicator assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, remote sensing data provide valuable information on crops. This study investigates the relationship between the variables determined from both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images and crop height. For this purpose, backscatter (σVH, σVV, σVH / σVV) and coherence (ϒVH, ϒVV) of multi-temporal dual-polarized Sentinel-1 and vegetation indices of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data are analyzed. Two indices, namely, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NDVI with the red-edge band (NDVIred), are interpreted to identify the contribution of the red-edge band over the near-infrared band. The Zile District of Tokat province in Turkey where dominantly sunflower cultivation is carried out, was selected as the study area. In the analysis of the data, Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were used. In the results of the study, ANN showed the lowest RMSE = 3.083 cm (RMSE%= 11.284) in the stem elongation period. The CNN followed the lowest RMSE for the Inflorescence development and flowering stages 19.223 cm (RMSE%=15.458) and 8.731 cm (RMSE%=5.821), respectively. In the ripening period, XGBoost achieved the lowest RMSE = 8.731 cm (RMSE%=6.091).

This study attempts to address this problem through a novel mapping framework that is based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), feature optimization, and the random forest (RF) model (GFORF). This framework was built to map high-accuracy wetland data on the headwaters of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Indus rivers (HBGIR) in the western Tibetan Plateau (TP). Four time periods were examined: 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017. Our results showed that the overall accuracy for the acquired wetland data was 82.73%, 83.16%, 82.47%, and 88.14% in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, the feature optimization results showed that the spectral indices feature was the main contributor to the accuracy of wetland mapping, with the highest value being 26.9%. The seasonal factors, surface reflectance, auxiliary data, and texture contributed 21.8%, 21.6%, 21.5%, and 8.1%, respectively. Combining the seasonal features and auxiliary data of distances to rivers significantly improved the mapping accuracy of the wetlands by approximately 14%, 24%, 11%, and 10% in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017, respectively. In addition, our analysis showed that the wetland areas in the HBGIR amounted to 5177.39 km2, accounting for 5.82% of the total area.

Identifying dust-source areas is thus a fundamental task to control the effects of this hazard. This study is the first attempt to identify dust source areas using hybridized machine-learning algorithms. Each hybridized model, designed as an intelligent system, consists of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), integrated with a combination of metaheuristic optimization algorithms: the bat algorithm (BA), cultural algorithm (CA), and differential evolution (DE). The data acquired from two key sources – the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) – are incorporated into the hybridized model, along with relevant data from field surveys and dust samples. Goodness-of-fit analyses are performed to evaluate the predictive capability of the hybridized models using different statistical criteria, including the true skill statistic (TSS) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results demonstrate that the hybridized ANFIS-DE model (with AUC = 84.1%, TSS = 0.73) outperforms the other comparative hybridized models tailored for dust-storm prediction.

At present, due to the limitation of statistical data collection scale, it is difficult to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of carbon emission and its influence mechanism at a finer scale in China. With the development of new remote sensing platforms and technologies, multisource remote sensing data such as nighttime light remote sensing data and XCO2 concentration data have become important information resources for carbon emission monitoring. Therefore, this study monitors the spatiotemporal evolution of carbon emissions in China based on multisource remote sensing data and conducts impact mechanism research. The main conclusions of this study include: (1) The partial least squares carbon emission estimation model and the downscaled inversion model estimate carbon emissions with high accuracy. The estimated carbon emissions of both have high correlation with statistical carbon emissions, with R2 of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively, and no significant overestimation or underestimation. (2) The overall spatial pattern of energy consumption carbon emissions in China from 2010 to 2018 is high in the east and low in the west and high in the north and low in the south, but this spatial distribution pattern is gradually weakening. China's energy consumption carbon emissions varied considerably from 2010 to 2018, with an overall slow positive growth trend. (3) The mechanisms of population growth, economic development, urbanization and industrialization on carbon emissions are more complex, and most of their influencing factors promote carbon emission generation, while carbon emission impacts have spatial spillover. This study designs and studies a regional energy consumption carbon emission estimation model in China based on multisource remote sensing data, and explores the characteristics of regional multiscale carbon emission spatiotemporal variation and its influence mechanism, so as to provide scientific references for China's carbon emission reduction targets.","2023-11-15","2024-01-19 10:23:29","2024-01-19 10:23:29","","119054","","","346","","Journal of Environmental Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Energy consumption carbon emissions; Partial least squares; Remote sensing of nighttime lights; Space Durbin model; XCO concentration data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To develop the DAKIS, we specified, together with stakeholders, requirements for a knowledge-based decision-support tool and reviewed the literature to identify limitations in the current generation of tools. The results of the review point towards recurring challenges regarding the consideration of ecosystem services and biodiversity, the capacity to foster communication and cooperation between farmers and other actors, and the ability to link multiple spatiotemporal scales and sustainability levels. To overcome these challenges, the DAKIS provides a digital platform to support farmers' decision-making on land use and management via an integrative spatiotemporally explicit approach that analyses a wide range of data from various sources. The approach integrates remote and in situ sensors, artificial intelligence, modelling, stakeholder-stated demand for biodiversity and ecosystem services, and participatory sustainability impact assessment to address the diverse drivers affecting agricultural land use and management design, including natural and agronomic factors, economic and policy considerations, and socio-cultural preferences and settings. Ultimately, the DAKIS embeds the consideration of ecosystem services, biodiversity, and sustainability into farmers' decision-making and enables learning and progress towards site-adapted small-scale multifunctional and diversified agriculture while simultaneously supporting farmers' objectives and societal demands.","2023-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:29","2024-01-19 10:23:29","","100274","","","16","","Environmental Science and Ecotechnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biodiversity; Decision support system; Digital agriculture; Ecosystem services; Farming practices; Modelling; Small-scale management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The unique terrain characteristics of a particular landscape are derived from DEM, which are responsible for initiation and development of ephemeral gullies. As the topographic features of an area significantly influences on the erosive power of the water flow, it is an important task the extraction of terrain features from DEM to properly research gully erosion. Alongside, topography is highly correlated with other geo-environmental factors i.e. geology, climate, soil types, vegetation density and floristic composition, runoff generation, which ultimately influences on gully occurrences. Therefore, terrain morphometric attributes derived from DEM data are used in spatial prediction of gully erosion susceptibility (GES) mapping. In this study, remote sensing-Geographic information system (GIS) techniques coupled with machine learning (ML) methods has been used for GES mapping in the parts of Semnan province, Iran. Current research focuses on the comparison of predicted GES result by using three types of DEM i.e. Advanced Land Observation satellite (ALOS), ALOS World 3D-30 m (AW3D30) and Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) in different resolutions.

ML methods of conditional inference forests (Cforest), Cubist model and Elastic net model have been chosen for modelling GES accordingly. Variable’s importance of GECFs was measured through sensitivity analysis and result show that elevation is the most important factor for occurrences of gullies in the three aforementioned ML methods (Cforest = 21.4, Cubist = 19.65 and Elastic net = 17.08), followed by lithology and slope.

Although previous studies have confirmed great advantages ofunmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) remote sensing for LAI estimation in the field, accurate, reliable and efficient LAI estimation with practical applications still faces challenges due to model limitations and variations in the spectral and spatial scales of UAV remote sensing. In this study, we constructed the hybrid inversion models (HIMs) for estimating maize LAI using UAV hyperspectral and multispectral data, respectively. The HIMs combines the advantages of radiative transfer models and machine learning regression algorithms, and are optimized by active learning (AL) algorithm. The results reveal that the inclusion of AL in the HIMs an effectively improve the accuracy of the model. The Gaussian process regression-based HIM with AL (GPR-AL-HIM) obtained the best performance in LAI estimation (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.30 and NRMSE = 10.16 %). Meanwhile, GPR-AL-HIM was also determined to outperform the physical model based on the look-up-table (LUT) and the empirical statistical model based on vegetation indices. The model was validated with another independent dataset and also obtained a high accuracy (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.23 and NRMSE = 11.78 %). In addition, we also explore the effects of the UAV spectral (multispectral and hyperspectral) and image spatial resolution on LAI inversion. The results reveal that the hyperspectral data exhibit an advantage over the multispectral data for LAI inversion using the GPR-AL-HIM. The accuracy of the GPR-AL-HIM decreased with increasing spatial resolution, but the accuracy varied less within a certain spatial resolution range (e.g., R2of 0.86–0.84 and RMSE of 0.30–0.33 for hyperspectral images at 1.5–15 cm spatial resolution). Furthermore, the LAI distribution in the study area was accurately mapped using the GPR-AL-HIM with the hyperspectral and multispectral images, with the latter exhibiting lower uncertainties. The GPR-AL-HIM is mainly aimed at maize, and in the future, we will explore the applicability of this model in other crops.

The results suggest that the levels of coupling coordination increase to different degrees in YRB and its provinces from 2000 to 2019, and the coupling types are characterized by pyramidal-shaped distribution. The regions of YRB are divided into four development types: water-driven type, energy-driven type, food-driven type, and economy-driven type. Spatially, a dominant factor zone is formed with a multi-polar core. Furthermore, some practical suggestions are put forward to promote the effective utilization of water resources and high-quality development according to specific regional situations in YRB. This study will promote coupling coordination and high-quality development in YRB, providing a reference for the coordination of the human-land relationship and regional sustainable development.","2022-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:29","2024-01-19 10:23:29","","128461","","","614","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Geographic detector model; Improved coupling coordination degree; Nighttime light; Poverty; The Yellow River Basin (YRB); Water-energy-food (WEF)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, machine learning methods were employed to study some interactions between the different dimensions that constitute an urban socio-ecosystem that caused these variations. We proposed a methodology that considered two phases: a) field work to collect data on 300 soil samples; laboratory analysis to measure the concentrations of 24 macronutrients, micronutrients, and trace nutrients; and the design of geophysical, spectral, and urban co-variables; b) statistical and geo-informatics analysis, where multivariate analysis grouped the elements into factors; and, machine learning integrated with co-variables was applied to derive the intensity of each factor across the city. Multivariate statistics described the variation in soil co-concentrations with a moderate percentage (42%). Four factors were determined that grouped some of the analyzed elements, as follows: F1 (Zn, S, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cr), F2 (Ba, Ag, K, In, and Mg), F3 (B, V, Li, and Sr), and F4 (Si and Mn).

Forecasting the state of food insecurity is essential to be able to trigger early actions, for example, by humanitarian actors. To measure the actual state of food insecurity, expert and consensus-based approaches and surveys are currently used. Both require substantial manpower, time, and budget. This paper introduces an extreme gradient-boosting machine learning model to forecast monthly transitions in the state of food security in Ethiopia, at a spatial granularity of livelihood zones, and for lead times of one to 12 months, using open-source data. The transition in the state of food security, hereafter referred to as predictand, is represented by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Data. From 19 categories of datasets, 130 variables were derived and used as predictors of the transition in the state of food security. The predictors represent changes in climate and land, market, conflict, infrastructure, demographics and livelihood zone characteristics. The most relevant predictors are found to be food security history and surface soil moisture. Overall, the model performs best for forecasting Deteriorations and Improvements in the state of food security compared to the baselines. The proposed method performs (F1 macro score) at least twice as well as the best baseline (a dummy classifier) for a Deterioration. The model performs better when forecasting long-term (7 months; F1 macro average = 0.61) compared to short-term (3 months; F1 macro average = 0.51). Combining machine learning, Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) ratings from monitoring systems, and open data can add value to existing consensus-based forecasting approaches as this combination provides longer lead times and more regular updates. Our approach can also be transferred to other countries as most of the data on the predictors are openly available from global data repositories.","2021-09-10","2024-01-19 10:23:29","2024-01-19 10:23:29","","147366","","","786","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Early warning systems; Extreme gradient boosting; Food security; IPC; Machine learning; Open data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thanks to its all-time and all-weather capability, integrating multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for crop mapping has become essential and challenging task in remote sensing. In recent years, deep learning (DL) has demonstrated excellent crop mapping accuracy to interpret crop dynamics. However, existing DL-based methods tend to be incapable of capturing spatial and temporal features at different scales simultaneously, and this often leads to severe mis-classification due to the complex and heterogeneous distribution of crops and diverse phenological patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal multi-level attention method, named as STMA, for crop mapping using time-series SAR imagery in an end-to-end fashion to increase the capability of crop phenology retrieval. Specifically, the multi-level attention mechanism is designed to aggregate multi-scale spatio-temporal representations on crops via cascaded spatio-temporal self-attention (STSA) and multi-scale cross-attention (MCA) modalities. To ensure a fine extraction of multi-granularity features, a learnable spatial attention position encoding is proposed to adaptively generate the position priors to facilitate multi-level attention learning. Experimental results on Brandenburg Sentinel-1 dataset, public PASTIS-R dataset and South Africa dataset demonstrated that STMA can achieve state-of-the-art performance in crop mapping tasks, with the accuracy of 96.54% in the Brandenburg Sentinel-1 dataset, 86.77% in the PASTIS-R dataset and 83.37% in the South Africa dataset, validating its effectiveness and superiority. Further comparison of spatio-temporal generalization capability reflected its excellent performance in spatio-temporal modeling on different crops and scenarios. This research provides a viable and intelligent spatio-temporal framework for large-area crop mapping using time-series SAR imagery in complex agricultural systems.

Accurate estimation of AGB and carbon stocks in this biome is important for addressing sustainable development goals as the information can aid natural resource management at varied spatial scales. Previous AGB mapping efforts focused on humid forests, with little attention on savannas. This study explored the use of annual monthly time-series of Senitinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map AGB in the SS. Backscatter, spectral reflectance, and derivatives (vegetation indices and biophysical parameters) were combined with field inventory data in a Random Forest regression to map AGB. Eight experiments were conducted with different data configurations to determine: (1) the potential of S-1 and S-2 for AGB mapping, (2) optimal image acquisition period for AGB mapping, and (3) contribution of image derivatives to improving the accuracy of AGB mapping. The predicted map was validated with 40% of the inventory data. Uncertainty in the AGB was assessed using mean absolute error, root mean squared error, coefficient of determination and symmetrical mean absolute percentage error. Results show that about 90% of the study area have low AGB stocks of less than 90 Mg/ha. Compared to S-1 (RMSE: 78.6; MAE: 25.6), S-2 achieved better prediction accuracy (RMSE: 60.6; MAE: 19.2), although combination of the two according to seasonality produced the best results (RMSE: 45.4; MAE: 16.3). Images acquired in the dry season were found to be more useful for predicting AGB than those of rainy season. Also, stress-related vegetation indices and a red-edge dependent normalized difference vegetation index not tested in previous AGB studies using Sentinels were found to be significant contributors to the superior performance of S-2. Since biomass is a finite resource, our results can provide valuable information on the sustainable use of biomass and energy security including studies on carbon cycling and ecosystem functions in the region. The demonstrated possibility of using open access earth observation data to map and monitor AGB in data scarce regions is useful and beneficial to attaining SDG indicators 15.2.1 (sustainable forest management) and 15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over total land area).

Stakeholders can make informed decisions and implement targeted strategies to achieve multiple SDGs related to agriculture, rural development, and sustainable livelihoods by understanding the spatial dynamics of these systems. Accurate information on the extent of ICLS derived from multitemporal remote sensing and emerging map techniques such as deep learning can help in the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. However, far too little attention has been paid to ICLS map accuracy because it may not be at the forefront of research agendas compared to those of other agricultural practices. This paper aims to map ICLS using high spatiotemporal resolution imagery and deep learning neural network classifiers at two different sites located in Brazil. The pipeline involves four interpretation approaches based on the ICLS class: evaluating deep neural network classifiers with different image composition intervals, explaining commission and omission errors, evaluating the temporal transferability of the method, and evaluating the influence of variables. The study area consists of two locations in São Paulo (study site 1, SS1) and Mato Grosso state (study site 2, SS2), Brazil. We derived nine spectral variables from PlanetScope (PS) images and four metrics through object-based image analysis (OBIA) using two time intervals, 10 and 15 days, to generate the image compositions. These input variables were used in three deep neural network classifiers: convolutional neural network in one dimension (Conv1D), long short-term memory (LSTM), and LSTM with a fully convolutional network (LSTM-FCN). Our results showed that mapping dynamic land use such as ICLS is possible by using high-spatiotemporal-resolution imagery and deep neural network classifiers. The 15-day LSTM-FCN classifier returned the highest map accuracies for both sites, with the following class-level accuracies: producer accuracy (PA) = 97.0% and user accuracy (UA) = 97.0% for SS1 and PA = 82.0% and UA = 96.5% for SS2. Meanwhile, we found map uncertainties arising from the diverse crop calendars and spectro-temporal similarities between ICLS and other land use. The best approaches revealed that temporal generalization was suitable for mapping ICLS, but some classifiers could not generalize due to the inherent characteristics of the class. Most variables were considered efficient for predicting ICLS, although spectral indices revealed better functional relationships, while the PS bands had a lower influence on the predictions. The accuracies achieved with the proposed method represent promising opportunities for the sufficiently accurate mapping of ICLS and other complex crop activities.","2023-12-15","2024-01-19 10:23:29","2024-01-19 10:23:29","","113886","","","299","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Crop classification; OBIA; Shapley additive exPlanations; Sustainable agriculture; Temporal generalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, inequality in school greenspaces has drawn growing attention, given the importance of campus green environments in young students’ health and academic performance. However, the commonly used Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI) method for measuring greenspace from satellite imagery is hindered by the saturation issue and tend to underestimate greenspace at high vegetation cover areas, causing large uncertainties in greenspace inequality studies at a national scale. Besides, despite the progress on the inequality of public greenspace exposure, our understandings of primary school greenspace provision and inequality, as well as the driving factors, for young students in a developing world (e.g., China) is still limited. To address these issues, we first adapted a spectral unmixing technique based on multi-sensor remote sensing for more accurate measurements of greenspace provision. Then, we evaluated the provision and inequality of greenspace for 19,681 primary schools in China’s 31 major cities and examined the driving factors using an integrated path analysis. Our findings revealed that: (1) Our proposed multi-sensor remote sensing-based method for greenspace measurement is reliable across our study area with a R2 of 0.81 and RMSE of 0.14; in contrast, the traditional NDVI-based greenspace measurement saturated at the range of 0.7–1.0, leading to much lower accuracy (a R2 of 0.72 and RMSE of 0.24). (2) Most of the cities under study had low to moderate levels of inequality in primary school greenspace (Gini index < 0.5), but the overall greenspace provision was relatively low; Five cities under study facing high inequality in greenspace exposure (Gini index ≥ 0.5) as well as low greenspace provision (mean fraction cover < 0.25). (3) The monthly maximum temperature and the mean cover of greenspace in primary schools were identified as variables directly affecting the inequality in primary school greenspace (R2 = 0.76, p-value < 0.05), whereas the city-level government revenue manifests its effects through the mean cover of greenspace in primary schools and city-level mean greenspace cover. By developing a novel framework for examining the provision and inequality of greenspace in all primary schools in China’s major cities, our study provides valuable insights for designing and evaluating school greening programs in support of healthier learning environment development for next generations.","2022-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:30","2024-01-19 10:23:30","","127670","","","75","","Urban Forestry & Urban Greening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Big cities; Children’s health and well-being; Education inequality; Environmental justice; School greenspace; Vegetation fraction cover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurate measurements of urban morphological and demographic figures are at the core of many international endeavors to address issues of urbanization, such as the United Nations’ call for “Sustainable Cities and Communities”. In many countries – particularly developing countries –, however, this database does not yet exist. Here, we demonstrate a novel deep learning and big data analytics approach to fuse freely available global radar and multi-spectral satellite data, acquired by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Via this approach, we created the first-ever global and quality controlled urban local climate zones classification covering all cities across the globe with a population greater than 300,000 and made it available to the community (https://doi.org/10.14459/2021mp1633461). Statistical analysis of the data quantifies a global inequality problem: approximately 40% of the area defined as compact or light/large low-rise accommodates about 60% of the total population, whereas approximately 30% of the area defined as sparsely built accommodates only about 10% of the total population. Beyond, patterns of urban morphology were discovered from the global classification map, confirming a morphologic relationship to the geographical region and related cultural heritage. We expect the open access of our dataset to encourage research on the global change process of urbanization, as a multidisciplinary crowd of researchers will use this baseline for spatial perspective in their work. In addition, it can serve as a unique dataset for stakeholders such as the United Nations to improve their spatial assessments of urbanization.","2022-02-01","2024-01-19 10:23:30","2024-01-19 10:23:30","","112794","","","269","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Big data; Data fusion; Deep learning; Global inequality; Global urban LCZ dataset; Local climate zones; Remote sensing; Sentinels; Urban morphology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Physical urban areas (PUA) are fundamental indicators to monitoring and evaluating urbanization, which differ from administrative urban areas and are much complicated to identify, as PUA contain heterogeneous land uses which are shaped by variant physical structures and diverse socioeconomic activities. Previous studies extracted PUA by densely populated, night-lighted, built-up, or artificial impervious surfaces, which consider either physical or socioeconomic aspect of PUA, but cannot measure both. Accordingly, this study firstly integrates physical and socioeconomic features derived from high-resolution (HR) satellite images and points of interests (POI) to extract HR land uses; then, a knowledge-based morphological aggregation method is proposed to aggregate different land uses and generate PUA based on spatial land-use structures. As the result, 450 PUA in 81 major Chinese cities are extracted and a China PUA dataset (namely CPUA) is generated. The CPUA is evaluated by reference to a widely-used global urban boundary dataset. The evaluation shows an accuracy of 92.5 %, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method and the reliability of generated dataset. The evaluation also indicates that the generated CPUA outperforms the reference dataset in identifying urban parks and eliminating rural homesteads. Furthermore, the CPUA can be employed as fundamental data to monitor urbanization process and its spatial patterns, and thus plays an important role in evaluating sustainable city development.

Quantifying the albedo in Greenland ice sheet, which is extensively covered with snow and ice, is key to studying changes in the energy budget in the Northern Hemisphere. Earth observation satellites have been regularly providing surface albedo products. However, optical satellite-derived albedo products have many voids due to the persistent cloud cover over the Greenland ice sheet. Consequently, seamless reconstruction of albedo on the spatial and temporal scales is essential. Surface albedo, as a geographical element, is spatially and temporally correlated. In addition, the broadband albedo of snow and ice is significantly modified by changes in the spectral distribution of solar irradiance caused by clouds. On the basis of such facts, this study proposes a reconstruction method for snow and ice albedo that combines spatiotemporal information with a physics-informed model. This method uses spatiotemporal nonlocal filtering to generate the initial reference albedo for missing pixels. Then, the hypothetical clear-sky albedo is reconstructed using the Whittaker iterator. Finally, cloudy albedo is obtained on the basis of the empirical relationship between clear-sky and cloudy-sky albedos. We reconstruct albedo based on MOD10A1 for the whole Greenland region from 2001 to 2020. A comparison between the reconstruction results and ground measurements exhibits satisfactory accuracy with an R-value of 0.8162, a root-mean-square error of 0.0669, a mean absolute error of 0.0486, and a bias of 0.00001. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates the advantages of being more accurate and robust than other classical methods. Therefore, this study will be valuable for generating 500 m daily remotely sensed albedo of snow and ice in large regions.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:30","2024-01-19 10:23:30","","103519","","","124","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Albedo; Gap-filling; Greenland; Snow and ice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, an updated soil salinity map with high accuracy and resolution is urgently needed to help local governments conduct precise management. In this study, a bootstrap hybrid machine learning framework was developed combine Sentinel-2 data and environmental covariates. The Boruta algorithm was applied to input the spectral information and environmental variables to identify the primary factors influencing soil salinity. By averaging 100 model iterations within a bootstrap framework, the soil salinity mapping outcomes were compared from four machine learning methods (bagging, classification and regression tree, random forest, and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT)). The results showed that the models driven by spectral information and environmental covariates (strategy II) explained 68∼88% of the variability in soil salinity. The model accuracy of strategy II was improved by 5%-8% over that of the models driven only by spectral information (strategy I). The GBRT yielded the most appropriate averaging performance of the four machine learning approaches within strategy II, with an R2 of 0.88, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.33 dS m−1, a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 4.66 and model stability (ROB) of 0.44. The bootstrap averaging method was relatively stable and had high accuracy potential. The distribution of soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region was the result of a combination of natural and human activity influences. The proposed approach provides a soil salinity mapping strategy with a fine resolution (10 m) and high accuracy in data-poor places.

Mapping of the different types of damages caused by the disease is challenging in high density ecosystems in which spectral variability is high due to canopy heterogeneity. Data obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be particularly useful for such tasks due to the high resolution, flexibility of acquisition and cost efficiency of this type of data. In this study, A. glutinosa decline was assessed by considering four categories of tree health status in the field: asymptomatic, dead and defoliation above and below a 50% threshold. A combination of multispectral Parrot Sequoia and UAV unmanned aerial vehicles -red green blue (RGB) data were analysed using classical random forest (RF) and a simple and robust three-step logistic modelling approaches to identify the most important forest health indicators while adhering to the principle of parsimony. A total of 34 remote sensing variables were considered, including a set of vegetation indices, texture features from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a digital surface model (DSM), topographic and digital aerial photogrammetry-derived structural data from the DSM at crown level. Results: The four categories identified by the RF yielded an overall accuracy of 67%, while aggregation of the legend to three classes (asymptomatic, defoliated, dead) and to two classes (alive, dead) improved the overall accuracy to 72% and 91% respectively. On the other hand, the confusion matrix, computed from the three logistic models by using the leave-out cross-validation method yielded overall accuracies of 75%, 80% and 94% for four-, three- and two-level classifications, respectively. Discussion: The study findings provide forest managers with an alternative robust classification method for the rapid, effective assessment of areas affected and non-affected by the disease, thus enabling them to identify hotspots for conservation and plan control and restoration measures aimed at preserving black alder forests.","2021-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:30","2024-01-19 10:23:30","","61","","","8","","Forest Ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3D point cloud; Alder; Defoliation; Multi-spectral; RPAS; Texture variables; Tree health monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The amount of groundwater extraction over the years has been greater than the natural replenishment capacity, as a result the water table has significantly decreased. This study mainly aims to identify critical locations for groundwater recharge. The land covers in 1996 and 2011 were generated based on Landsat satellite image with a 30 × 30 m resolution. The 2030 land cover was modeled with a land change modeler, The Arc-Curve number tool was used to calculate the curve number (CN). Runoff was calculated with the SCS runoff equation. Compared to that in 1996, the forest and agriculture area in 2011 decreased, whereas the vegetation and built-up areas increased. From 2011 to 2030, no changes in forest, decrease in vegetation and agriculture area, and increase in the built-up area are observed. The water area throughout the study periods is less than 0.2%. The city center of Kathmandu Valley has higher CN, greater than 85, for all the observed periods, as a result, a higher runoff is observed. The weighted average CNs are 63 and 65 for 2011 and 2030, respectively. The northern and southern parts of Kathmandu Valley has lower CNs; hence, the lower runoff and possibly higher infiltration indicate critical locations for the groundwater recharge.

Studies conducted at tree or plot scales on the supply of ecosystem services (ES) suggest that agroforestry practices are a promising way to build multifunctional agricultural landscapes. However, the current characterization and understanding of how multiple ES are associated across such heterogeneous agricultural landscapes are still limited. This study provides the first characterization of the multiple ESs supplied by a Sahelian Faidherbia albida agroforestry parkland and their relationships. Relying on field data for 11 ES indicators, recent advances in remote sensing-derived information, and blending different ES mapping approaches, we first assessed the spatial heterogeneity of the supply of each ES. We found that the majority of ES indicators remained below ES potential values over the study area by 25 % to 50 %, revealing that there is a considerable scope for increasing the ES supply in the F. albida parkland. Then, using a scoring approach, we analyzed the supply of multiple ESs. We observed a large number of hotspots and a clear effect of the proximity of F. albida trees fostering the supply of multiple ESs in their vicinity. Finally, we mapped and analyzed the dominant relationships – trade-offs, synergies or losses – between ESs from a cooccurrence spatial approach. We showed that significant trade-offs and losses (58 % of the area) between ESs can exist in the F. albida parkland. Interestingly, we also showed that synergies occurred mainly up to 10 m from the F. albida trees, suggesting that synergies need to be increased beyond this threshold.

Governments are responding to that challenge by investing in mineral systems research and by by making government geoscience datasets freely available to the public and explorers. However, translating conceptual mineral system models to mappable geological, geochemical, and geophysical proxies is difficult with incomplete data of variable quality from modern and legacy surveys. Herein we address those knowledge gaps and propose a new open source workflow in R for prospectivity modelling using public geoscience datasets. We focus on the largest footprints of magmatic Ni (±Cu) sulphide mineral systems and their critical raw materials (±Co ± PGE). Multiple prospectivity models are presented, including data-driven methods (e.g., weights of evidence, gradient boosting machines) that use the features of known mineral occurrences as a training set and a hybrid method that also incorporates conceptual mineral system criteria. All models are validated using data from northern Canada (i.e., north of 60° latitude) as a test set. Statistical analysis of the prospectivity results suggests that rock types and geological ages are two of the most important predictive datasets, which correspond to the sources and drivers within the mineral system framework, respectively. Variable importance plots further suggest that geological boundaries (e.g., horizontal gradient magnitude of the gravity data and multi–scale edges) and the close spatial association between areas of high mineral potential and the edges of thick continental crust represent prospective ore-forming pathways. Model performance and the best combination of predictors and hyperparameters for each model are based on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) plots, which yield a range of area under the curve (AUC) from 0.846 to 0.923 for the spatially independent test set. Most Canadian geological provinces, possibly with the exception of the Grenville orogen for the hybrid and weights of evidence methods (AUC = 0.716–0.726), yield comparable model performance, suggesting that the heterogeneous spatial distribution of different mineral system sub-types (e.g., komatiite-associated, rift-related, Alaskan-type, and hydrothermal awaruite) have a relatively minor impact on the prospectivity results. Monte Carlo-type simulations further suggest that the expert weightings used in the hybrid method (AUC = 0.843) are only slightly better than an average model constructed from random combinations of weightings (AUC = 0.809). The general agreement between different methods and multiple iterations of the same model demonstrate that public geoscience datasets can effectively reduce the search space to support mineral exploration targeting (i.e., less than 8% of map pixels contain more than 80% of the known Ni mineralization). However, vast segments of the Canadian landmass have not undergone systematic geological surveying or data acquisition. Prospectivity modelling can thus also be used by governments and academia to prioritize areas for future targeted geoscience research.","2021-05-01","2024-01-19 10:23:30","2024-01-19 10:23:30","","103985","","","132","","Ore Geology Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Exploration; Machine learning; Mafic; Mineral potential; Mineral system; Ultramafic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in Bandung, one of Indonesia’s strategic cities, only 63% of the population has access to proper sanitation. Therefore, this study aims to identify priority areas for developing a centralized WWTP system using models that consider wastewater production and the availability of sanitation access on a building scale. The novelty of this study lies in integrating wastewater production models and sanitation access availability to prioritize developing WWTP systems at the building level and developing a pipeline model to connect WWTP candidate points with priority building targets. We also analyzed the suitability of optimal WWTP locations to support the development of wastewater treatment systems and determine wastewater pipeline routes using the optimal path method in priority areas. To model wastewater production, we used the number of residents per building and building area as the basis. The availability of sanitation access was modeled by considering the percentage of access per district, identifying urban slums, and analyzing proximity to existing wastewater pipes and rivers. After the modeling process, we classified nine development priority classes. Our results revealed that there is approximately 7.38 km2 of priority area for developing a wastewater treatment system in Bandung which comprises 67,135 priority buildings and 178 potential sites for WWTP. These priority areas are mostly located in the districts of Bojongloa Kaler, Astanaanyar, Batununggal, Kiaracondong, Cibeunying Kidul, Coblong, and Sukajadi.

Despite this, research on trend tracking and spatial pattern identifying in productivity of China's stable croplands at a national scale is currently lacking. Here, we attempted to fill this gap based on satellite observation data and cloud computing platform, using the crop growth index, quadratic regression model, and indicator-based spatial overlay analysis. Results show the productivity of China's stable cropland rose by ∼31.07% from 2001 to 2020 but will fall to ∼78.89% to ∼85.78% of the 2015 level (baseline year of SDGs) by 2030. The declining trends can be attributed to three main factors: (1) 69.15% of cropland that previously exhibited significant productivity growth has started to decline; (2) the productivity of cropland with the highest agricultural suitability (Level 4–5) has been long-term declining, showing no signs of reversing; (3) 44.12% of stable cropland's productivity was volatile over the research period, leading to high uncertainty in productivity growth. The large-scale spatial overlap between high agricultural suitability and human activity intensity determined the spatial pattern of stable cropland productivity. Therefore, comprehending and mitigating urbanization's indirect and off-site detrimental impacts on cropland productivity are critical to ensuring China's future food security.","2023-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:30","2024-01-19 10:23:30","","107136","","","101","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural productivity; Cropland; Food security; GEE; Remote sensing; Spatial pattern","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effects of soil on crop-climate responses are often ignored in crop yield prediction. We investigated the effects of soil texture and soil organic carbon concentration (SOC) on the yield responses of seven major crops (corn, winter wheat, soybean, cotton, barley, oats, rice) to growing season precipitation and temperature between 1958 and 2019 across the conterminous US. We also evaluated the effects of irrigation and groundwater depth on crop-climate responses. Crop yields were most sensitive to precipitation and temperature variability in coarse-textured soils and less responsive to these weather parameters in medium- and fine- textured soils. Increasing SOC concentration (> 2%) contributed to crop yields being less sensitive to precipitation – due to increased water retention, and less responsive to temperature – presumably due to increased buffering capacity against increased water lost through evapotranspiration. Irrigation and an intermediate depth to groundwater increase the resilience of crops to precipitation and temperature changes and these effects were also dependent on soil texture and SOC. To enhance food security for a rapidly growing global population under a changing climate, best management practices should be adopted that improve soil structure and carbon stocks that can increase soil available water storage (“Green Water”) and nutrient retention and promote energy conservation. The spatial-temporal variations of soil texture, SOC, and depth to groundwater should be considered in agricultural and ecosystem modeling to more accurately capture crop yield response to climate variations.","2021-05-01","2024-01-19 10:23:30","2024-01-19 10:23:30","","103085","","","190","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4 per 1000; Best management practice (BMPs); Climate change; Soil carbon stock; Soil texture; Sustainable development goals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that urban green space is important for the mental and physical health of humans residing in cities and that urban green space may harbor unique biodiversity. Understanding the extent and drivers of urban green space is thus important. While urban green space has been mapped and studied at local to national scales, the global patterns and drivers of urban green space remain unknown, potentially hampering effective planning and allocation of resources toward reaching sustainable development goals. Here, we quantified the effect of environmental and socio-economic drivers (temperature, precipitation, human development, and population density) on urban green space globally by focusing on national capital cities. We used satellite imagery to map urban green space using two measures: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the fractional cover of “green” land cover classes. NDVI is useful as it includes all vegetated surfaces, also small ones like gardens. However, land cover classes allow the exclusion of certain classes such as sports fields or cropland. We used boosted regression trees to show that climatic variables accounted for 75 % of the relative influence in urban green space, with a positive effect of precipitation and a negative effect of temperature. Importantly, socioeconomic variables accounted for 25 % of the influence on global urban green space, with a positive effect of human development index (HDI) and a negative effect of population density. HDI in relation to urban green space has not previously been tested globally, and our study shows that significantly affects urban greenspace. The results demonstrate that cities where development status is low and population densities are high, typically in the Global South, have less urban green space than the climate would predict. The results therefore suggest that human wellbeing does not only benefit directly from increasing human development and decreasing population densities in urban areas, but that these effects may be compounded by also improving nature’s contribution to people.","2023-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:30","2024-01-19 10:23:30","","127980","","","86","","Urban Forestry & Urban Greening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate; Google earth engine; Remote sensing; Socioeconomic; Urban green space","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, quantifying the extent and change of these water bodies has been challenging due to environmental complexity, climatic diversity, and their highly dynamic nature in seasons and interannual periods. Most established remote-sensing water extraction methods involve a practical trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. To remedy these deficiencies, we proposed a simple and robust Automatic Threshold–based Multi-source data Combination algorithm to improve the efficiency and accuracy of water mapping, achieving monthly stable periodic monitoring. The algorithm fully considered the principles and advantages of Sentinel-1/2 images for water detection and performed adaptive optimal threshold calculation based on the Edge Otsu algorithm. A new product of Surface Water Dynamics in the Yangtze River Basin was generated on a monthly temporal scale and 10-m spatial scale from 2017 to 2020 using the algorithm based on the Google Earth Engine platform. The confusion matrix-based metrics based on sample points were 95.85 % (producer's accuracy), 99.16 % (user's accuracy), 97.41 % (overall accuracy), 0.95 (Matthews correlation coefficient), and 0.95 (Kappa coefficient). Furthermore, the overall correct extraction rate of water bodies can reach 95.85 % and 91.87 % for small water bodies, with commission and omission errors of 0.04 % and 0.03 % at the sub-pixel scale, respectively. The distribution of water bodies within the basin is highly uneven, and their changes exhibit a distinct seasonal trend. The maximum inundation extent occurred in August 2020 (summer, 53,372.88 km2), while the minimum inundation extent was observed in November 2019 (winter, 42,491.74 km2). The successful application of the algorithm in the Yangtze River Basin established a good benchmark for surface water monitoring of multi-source satellite observations and showed great potential for global-scale applications. It will assist the monitoring and evaluation services of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and provide solutions to more global and regional issues.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:30","2024-01-19 10:23:30","","130327","","","626","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google earth engine; Monthly; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Surface water mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current study, machine learning (ML)-based spatial statistics were used to identify the predisposing factors of gully formation processes in south-eastern Nigeria. A geospatial database was created using 262 gully locations, fragmented into four categories as dependent variables. A total of 20 predictor variables, including geomorphometry, terrain, geo-environmental factors, proximity, and climate, were fused into a multinomial logistic regression model. The model was then fitted using the nnet package in R after testing for multi-collinearity and spatial autocorrelation. The results revealed that the study area, which is a 7th-order drainage basin, is vulnerable to gullying, as expressed by Horton's laws of geomorphometry. The highest simulated probability range was observed for moderate gully (0.5512–0.7175), with terrain and climate as predictive factors, whereas the lowest simulated probability range was observed for full gully (0.1136–0.4107) as influenced by basin geomorphometry. Soil creep (0.3869–0.5317) and low gully (0.1025–0.5107), both driven by climate, proximity, and terrain factors, exhibited a moderate tendency for occurrence.

The alluvial gold mining process in Colombia, also known as placer mining, involves excavations using heavy machinery and creates large footprints of bare soil and mining ponds. The very dynamic nature of this extractive activity and its spread in rural and remote areas make its mapping and monitoring very challenging. The use of freely available satellite data of the Copernicus programme provides great new possibilities to study these activities and provides stakeholders integrated data to better understand the spatial and temporal extent of the activities and mitigate affected areas. The objective of this work is to assess the potential of Sentinel-2 data to identify mining areas and to understand the dynamics in landcover change over a study area located at the border of the municipalities of El Bagre and Zaragoza in Bajo Cauca, Colombia. The study utilizes a classification approach followed by post-processing using field knowledge on a set of images from 2016 to 2019. Sequential pattern mining of classified images shows the likelihood of certain annual and seasonal changes in mining-impacted landcover and in the natural vegetation. The results show a slight reduction in the detected mining areas from 2016 to 2019. On the other hand, there are more mining activities in the dry season than in the wet season. Excavated areas of bare soil have a 50% chance to remain in excavation over the considered period or they transition to non-vegetated areas or mining ponds. Vegetation loss due to the extractive activities corresponds to about 35% while recovered vegetated areas are 7% of the total excavated areas in June 2019. An analysis of abandoned sites using NDVI shows that it takes a much longer period than the one considered in this paper for potential natural recovery of vegetation.

This study attempts to assess the gender diversity in enrolment in GSTA programmes in developing countries in Asia using data available with the UN-affiliated Regional Centre in India. A survey was also conducted to gauge trainees’ comfort in a complex multi-cultural, multi-linguistic classroom environment. The analysis shows that female participation in short-term courses has been increasing rather steeply over the years (1995–2019). The enrolment has reached 30% in recent years. It is also observed that the female participants have preferred (about 10%) to enrol in physical Science and Technology (ST) -oriented courses such as Remote Sensing and GIS, Satellite Meteorology and Climate Change, and Space and Atmospheric Sciences when compared to electrical Engineering and Technology-oriented Satellite Communications and Global Navigation Satellite Systems courses that would require a strong knowledge of digital signals and systems theory. The survey study with a participation of 150 trainees from 17 countries shows that women trainees have a slight edge by 9% over the male counterparts in learning ST elements of the courses. At sub-regional levels, it is observed that participants from Indian sub-continent countries (ISC) are better by 15% than participants from South-east Asian Countries (SAC) and Central Asian Countries (CAC). As far as the course structure perspective is concerned, there has been a significant difference with 70% of the ISC trainees have found the courses as well-balanced covering equally both technology and applications, while only 36% and 56% of the trainees from SAC and CAC, respectively, have found the course as balanced. Importantly, the survey has revealed that the participants from SAC and CAC have a big challenge in apprehending lectures in English, as reflected by their top scores at 18% and 17%, respectively, compared with the corresponding value of the ISC trainees being 72%. Recommendations are suggested to sustain the female enrolment in long-term GSTA training programmes. Strategies that create family-friendly learning conditions, including joint education programmes involving lead institutions of the participants’ countries, are proposed to facilitate higher female participation.

Although volumes of studies involve wetlands, limited attention has been paid to the long-term changes and ecological values of inland lake wetlands in China. In this paper, land use/cover data of Dongting Lake wetland from 1995 to 2020 was generated based on Google Earth engine using Stacking algorithm. Subsequently, the spatial and temporal variation of wetland types was explored using dynamic analysis and correlation indices of land change. The main factors influencing the distribution of wetland vegetation were identified by Geodetector. Finally, the degree of impact of wetland changes on ecosystem service value was quantified based on the equivalence factor method. The results show that, in the past 25 years, wetland land use types had switched with each other more frequently, and a total of 294.94 km2 of wetland area had been lost, mainly due to the shrinkage of water, reeds and sedge. The main factors affecting wetland distribution are population density, GDP, elevation and sunshine duration, and the interaction of the drivers is mostly linearly enhanced with no weakening effect. In addition, the ecosystem service value of wetlands showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing, with a total loss of ¥87,000.99 million in wetland ESV. The results of the study can provide basic information and data for the preliminary work of planning and design, and demonstrate the importance of ecosystems in different regions. Based on the assessment results, it can provide an important basis for the construction of ecological security patterns and policy formulation for ecological civilization construction.","2022-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","108619","","","136","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dongting Lake; Driving factors; Ecosystem services value; Land use/cover data; Wetland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, algal toxins in lake water have not been routinely monitored and evaluated well and frequently so far. In this study, a total of 100 large lakes (>25 km2) in densely populated eastern China were studied, and a remote sensing scheme of human health risks from MCs based on Sentinel-3 OLCI data was developed. The spatial and temporal dynamics of MCs risk in eastern China lakes since OLCI satellite observation data (2016–2021) were first mapped. The results showed that most of the large lakes in eastern China (80 out of 100) were detected with the occurrence of a high risk of more than 1 pixel (300×300 m) at least once. Fortunately, in terms of lake areas, the frequency of high human health risks in most waters (70.93% of total lake areas) was as less as 1%. This indicates that drinking water intakes can be set in most waters from the perspective of MCs, yet the management departments are required to reduce cyanobacterial blooms. This study highlights the potential of satellite in monitoring and assessing the risk of algal toxins and ensuring drinking water safety.

Though several NTL products are global in extent, intrinsic city-specific factors that affect lighting, such as development levels, and social, economic, and cultural characteristics, are unique to each city, making the urban processes embedded in NTL signatures difficult to characterize, and limiting the scalability of urban change analyses. In this study, we propose a data-driven approach to detect urban changes from daily satellite-derived NTL data records that is adaptive across cities and effective at learning city-specific temporal patterns. The proposed method learns to forecast NTL signatures from past data records using neural networks and allows the use of large volumes of unlabeled data, eliminating annotation effort. Urban changes are detected based on deviations of observed NTL from model forecasts using an anomaly detection approach. Comparing model forecasts with observed NTL also allows identifying the direction of change (positive or negative) and monitoring change severity for tracking recovery. In operationalizing the model, we consider eleven urban areas from diverse geographic regions with dynamic NTL time-series and demonstrate the generalizability of the approach for detecting the change processes with different drivers and rates occurring within these urban areas based on NTL deviation. The proposed approach for monitoring changes from daily remote sensing observations efficiently utilizes large data volumes to support continuous monitoring and decision making.","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","113818","","","298","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Machine learning; Neural networks; Nighttime lights; Time-series; Urban change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The heterogeneity of built-up areas and infrastructures as well as the importance of not only mapping, but also characterizing anthropogenic structures suggests using a sub-pixel mapping approach for analysing related LC from space. We implement a regression-based unmixing approach for mapping built-up surfaces and infrastructure, woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation for all of Germany and Austria at 10 m resolution to demonstrate the potential of sub-pixel mapping. We map LC fractions for one point in time, using all available Sentinel-2 data from 2017 and 2018 (<70% cloud cover). We combine the concept of synthetically mixed training data with statistical aggregations from spectral-temporal metrics (STM) derived from Sentinel-2 reflectance time series. We specifically examine how STM can be used for creating synthetically mixed training data. STM are known to facilitate large area mapping by being largely independent of image acquisition dates and inherently incorporate phenological information. Vegetation is an important part of settlements and time series information supports its mapping. Synthetically mixed training data facilitates a streamlined training by using pure reference spectra to generate artificial mixtures as input to regression modelling of LC fractions in mixed pixels. We here show how combining both offers great potential for wall-to-wall LC fraction mapping. We further investigate the positive effect of STM on map results by comparing the performance of different subsets of STM combinations. Our results indicate that many STM combinations containing spectral variability and vegetation indices provide suitable input to creating synthetic training data for regression-based fraction mapping. Results for built-up surfaces and infrastructure (MAE 0.13/RMSE 0.18 at 20 m resolution), woody vegetation (0.18, 0.22) and non-woody vegetation (0.14, 0.19) are highly consistent across Germany and Austria. Only a few surface types were not accurately predicted in our nation-wide mapping. Further research is required to optimize mapping of temporally invariant bare soil and rock surfaces that show spectral similarity to built-up surfaces and infrastructure. The proposed methodology combines benefits of both regression-based modelling with synthetically mixed training data and STM, and thus facilitates mapping of LC fractions on a national scale and at high resolution. Such information will allow to better characterize settlements and identifying processes such as densification that are best represented by continuous LC mapping.","2020-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","111810","","","246","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Austria; Built-up; Germany; Land cover; Regression; Settlement; Unmixing; Urban","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Last decade, several fine particulate pollution episodes occurred in the vast area of China. In response to this, the Chinese government has stepped up efforts to tackle air pollution. In this paper, the temporal trends of PM2.5 and the quantitative potential impact of environmental governance on PM2.5 are analyzed for China. Due to the lack of historical records, a two-stage model was used to estimate the historical PM2.5 concentrations, combined with the newly released satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) product (MODIS Collection 6.1) and other data. The estimated PM2.5 concentrations showed strong consistency with the surface observations. Furthermore, significant seasonal variations existed in the PM2.5 concentrations and the temporal trends were captured, especially in city clusters. Then eight major city clusters were selected as typical samples. All the city clusters showed decrease trends in recent years, with PM2.5 concentrations in these regions decreased by 0.269–1.604 μg m−3 year−1. From 2006 to 2017, the annual PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 7.83%–26.35% in the major city clusters among China. Technological innovation and environmental governance play an important role in the decrease of PM2.5. In order to quantify the influence of governance, environmental regulation intensity and synergy were applied as the indicators of the internal governance and co-governance in each city cluster. In most city clusters, PM2.5 concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with regional internal governance and co-governance (R = −0.596 to −0.930, p < 0.05), and the effect on PM2.5 lasted for several years. However, 1- to 2-year lagged effect was found for governance, which means that the regulatory measures should be enhanced to decrease PM2.5 in the future to achieve the SDGs in China.","2020-04-10","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","134577","","","712","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerosol optical depth; Co-governance; Environmental regulation; PM; Spatiotemporal trends; Two-stage model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to analyze data related to slope, elevation, LULC, soil texture, precipitation, temperature, aspect, distance to river, soil moisture (NDMI), distance to road, and soil ph. These variables, according to the pair wise comparison results, have the most influence on suitability analysis and produce more accurate statistical analysis results. Additionally, spatial analyses were carried out to create the matrix that includes the adopted factors and their weights. The results demonstrate four agricultural land suitability areas: highly suitable (27.5%), moderately suitable (42.8%), marginally suitable (17.6%), and not suitable (12.1%). Suitability zones differ with district areas. An analysis of suitability per district showed that most of the areas are highly and moderately suitable for agriculture.

Using a multiple case analysis approach, the results suggest a distinction between technology providers and enablers as two different types of enterprises working towards developing and commercializing IoT technologies in BoP markets. The findings show that while providers tend to use knowledge on local constrains as inputs to design their activities to achieve local embeddedness, enablers incorporate local constrains in the early technology development process to design customized solutions for local community needs.

Poor and unscientific documentation of wildfire leads to error prone and quickly outdated event curation, making it difficult to create comprehensive overviews of wildfire events. Although several geospatial studies have recorded advances in wildfire data curation, many of these rely on structured spatial datasets which enjoy numerous advantages but can be prone to temporal or time-voids in data. Voids in data can be mitigated through interpolation techniques, but these are not without challenges for the modellers tasked with optimally filling the voids. On this backdrop, this paper therefore aims to test and extend strategies of wildfire reporting by investigating the strengths of fusing mainstream spatial data (including high resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) footage) with unstructured Twitter (tweets) data in order to disrupt common practise and contribute to the global agenda. The novelty of this contribution lies in its unusual hybrid data approach used to statistically establishes long- and short-term pre-fire conditions tested on the African landscape. It proceeds to illustrate how the social media data can create fascinating and yet accurate visual timelines of the events that surprisingly compared strongly to the results from structured sources. Finally, the study detects the extent of damage from the wildfire using supervised classification, burn indices and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. A 95% positive detection rate was reported, and it affirmed the place of unstructured data in mainstream scientific approaches such as wildfire documentation. The work presented therefore contributes towards meeting African Union's Agenda 2063 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (2030) in curation, documentation and mitigation of sustainable community and environments.","2023-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","e01656","","","20","","Scientific African","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Curation; Data fusion; Sustainable cities; UAV; Unstructured data; Wildfires","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several policies including rice fallow and decreasing cropping intensity have been implemented for food safety here. It is thus important to monitor rice planting area and cropping intensity to understand the effectiveness of those land-use policies. However, it is challenging to map rice planting areas due to the complex cropping systems (mixed single- and double-cropping), persistent cloud covers, small crop fields, let alone cropping intensity. Here we used all the available Sentinel-2 and all-weather Sentinel-1 imagery to generate a time series data cube to extract paddy rice planting areas and the rice cropping intensity in the Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan areas, which is a traditional rice-growing region with small farms in China. Specifically, we investigated the performances of different features (i.e., spectral, seasonal, polarization backscatter) by comparing five scenarios with different combinations of sensors and features, and identified the most suitable features for certain rice types (early, middle, and late rice). The random forest classifier was used for the classification in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and a reference map in 2017 based on visual interpretation on the GaoFen-2 images were used for collecting the training and validation samples. The results showed the combined data from Sentinel-1/2 generally outperformed classifications using only a single sensor (Sentinel-1/2), but the contribution of different sensors to certain rice types varied. The early, middle and late rice with the highest accuracies within the five scenarios had the overall accuracies of 85%, 95%, and 95%, respectively (F1 = 0.55, 0.85, and 0.85). The compositing of different types of rice allowed us to generate the rice cropping intensity map with an overall accuracy of 81%, which to our limited knowledge is the first effort to map cropping intensity at 10-m resolution in such a fragmented subtropical region. The result showed the single cropping dominated the rice cropping system in the study area 88%, which used to be a typical area with double cropping of rice.

Therefore, it demands a comprehensive assessment in terms of climate change vulnerability, adaptive capacity and resilience. We investigated the intrinsic resilience of this region by adopting Climate Change Resilience of Place (C-CROP) model. This study is the first attempt to the implication of the C-CROP model in real world scenario. Remote Sensing based earth observation, census, and ancillary data were in the centre of the investigation while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to select and weigh bottom level indicators. 20 adaptive capacity indicators and 17 vulnerability indicators were selected in this regard. Using PCA, 37 indicators are reduced to 5 adaptive capacity and 3 vulnerability principal components which explain 73.81% and 79.17% variance in the data respectively. Quantification and mapping of intrinsic resilience through geospatial approach using Google Earth Engine (GEE) provide useful data that show how intrinsic resilience is spatially distributed in the most vulnerable hotspot in the climate change context. The findings of the study can contribute to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction programs to sustainably allocate limited resources and set priority interventions in order to build vulnerable communities resilient in changing climatic scenario.","2023-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","100521","","","40","","Climate Risk Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive Capacity; C-CROP Model; Climate Change; PCA; Resilience; Vulnerability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the estimations of actual evapotranspiration fluxes within fields are essential to managing irrigation strategies to save water and preserve water resources. Among the indirect methods to estimate actual evapotranspiration, ETa, the eddy covariance (EC) method allows to acquire continuous measurement of latent heat flux (LE). However, the time series of EC measurements are sometimes characterized by a lack of data due to the sensors' malfunctions. At this aim, Machine Learning (ML) techniques could represent a powerful tool to fill possible gaps in the time series. In this paper, the ML technique was applied using the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm to fill gaps in daily actual evapotranspiration. The technique was tested in six different plots, two in Italy, three in the United States of America, and one in Canada, with different crops and climatic conditions in order to consider the suitability of the ML model in various contexts. For each site, the climate variables were not the same, therefore, the performance of the method was investigated on the basis of the available information. Initially, a comparison of ground and reanalysis data, where both databases were available, and between two different satellite products, when both databases were available, have been conducted. Then, the GPR model was tested. The mean and the covariance functions were set by considering a database of climate variables, soil water status measurements, and remotely sensed vegetation indices. Then, five different combinations of variables were analyzed to verify the suitability of the ML approach when limited input data are available or when the weather variables are replaced with reanalysis data. Cross-validation was used to assess the performance of the procedure. The model performances were assessed based on the statistical indicators: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), regression coefficient (b), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE). The quite high Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient, and the root mean square error (RMSE) low values confirm the suitability of the proposed algorithm.","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","108596","","","290","","Agricultural Water Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agro-meteorological and remote sensed data; Daily actual evapotranspiration; Gap-filling; Gaussian Process Regression (GPR); MODIS; Sentinel-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, a field investigation was carried out in the representative sample sites, and field-measured PSV was calibrated with wetland types, hydrological security, and aquatic plant biomass to perform spatial estimation and mapping of PSV. The estimation yielded average annual PSV of entire wetlands as 146.5 × 105 Indian Rupee (INR)/km2/year, with the highest over bheries (embankments for fish and shrimp aquaculture) 176 × 105 INR/km2/year and lowest over marshy wetlands 107 × 105 INR/km2/year. Sensitivity analysis of this estimation showed in cases of 55% field visited sites, the field-measured PSV was outside the range of low standard regression residuals (−0.5 to 0.5). While searching for the reason behind such error in the estimation, the variability of the field-measured PSV was measured. Various inequality measures showed high inequality in inter and intra-hydrological conditions of the wetland. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) proved statistical significance of within-class variability. To explain the variability of PSV, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plotting was performed, incorporating a few other regional conditioning factors like wetland size, fish and shrimp aquaculture, perenniality, expenditure, and external feeding from the experience of the field. From this excesize, external feeding and expenditure were essential factors that should be incorporated along with the wetland characteristics and physical attributes for accurate estimation. Since producing spatial data layers of these factors with a finer resolution is difficult, the study suggests case-specific estimation of PSV instead of general spatial mapping.","2023-01-15","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","116739","","","326","","Journal of Environmental Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrological security; Provisioning service value (PSV); Sample PSV variability and reasons of variability; Spatial mapping; Wetland types","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An effective multi-hazard risk mitigation strategy includes assessing individual hazards as well as their interactions. However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, multi-hazard susceptibility prediction techniques based on machine learning has encountered a huge bottleneck. In order to effectively solve this problem, this study proposes a multi-hazard susceptibility mapping framework using the classical deep learning algorithm of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). First, we use historical flash flood, debris flow and landslide locations based on Google Earth images, extensive field surveys, topography, hydrology, and environmental data sets to train and validate the proposed CNN method. Next, the proposed CNN method is assessed in comparison to conventional logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor methods using several objective criteria, i.e., coefficient of determination, overall accuracy, mean absolute error and the root mean square error. Experimental results show that the CNN method outperforms the conventional machine learning algorithms in predicting probability of flash floods, debris flows and landslides. Finally, the susceptibility maps of the three hazards based on CNN are combined to create a multi-hazard susceptibility map. It can be observed from the map that 62.43% of the study area are prone to hazards, while 37.57% of the study area are harmless. In hazard-prone areas, 16.14%, 4.94% and 30.66% of the study area are susceptible to flash floods, debris flows and landslides, respectively. In terms of concurrent hazards, 0.28%, 7.11% and 3.13% of the study area are susceptible to the joint occurrence of flash floods and debris flow, debris flow and landslides, and flash floods and landslides, respectively, whereas, 0.18% of the study area is subject to all the three hazards. The results of this study can benefit engineers, disaster managers and local government officials involved in sustainable land management and disaster risk mitigation.","2022-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","101425","","5","13","","Geoscience Frontiers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Convolutional Neural Network; Eastern Hindukush; Machine learning; Multi-hazard; Pakistan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence various types of research were made on flood prediction using Twitter data but it only focuses on classifying the text data as relevant or irrelevant, thereby loss of semantic information from longer phrases while extracting important information from Twitter text data and resulting in low accuracy of text classification. Hence, a novel BMLP and SDAE-HHNN has been proposed. This approach comprises BMLP and SDAE-HHNN techniques has been developed for effective flood prediction based on Twitter text data and image analysis. To classify the text data into two/six different classes, BERT is used to preprocess the text data from Twitter. To achieve high levels of precision, the Rule-Based Matching technique extracts specific place entities from the Named Entity Recognition. To predict the high probability location affected by flood from the place entity, bi-directional MLP (BMLP) is used which is made up of a finite number of sequential layers in its most basic form. Then images are extracted from this particular location and these images are processed to predict flood level but existing techniques cannot provide sufficient information to map the flood area and object detection due to real field data collection. Hence, a novel SDAE with HHNN has been developed in which SDAE removes noise from the specified extracted location and HHNN is used to classify the image into flood or non-flood. Then plot this sufficient predicted information related to flood level in the google map.

Overall, three critical aspects of agriculture are considered: (a) crop growth and yield through empirical models, physics-based models, and data assimilation in crop models, (b) applications pertaining to irrigation, which include mapping irrigation areas and quantification of irrigation, and (c) crop losses due to pests, diseases, crop lodging, and weeds. The emphasis is on satellite sensors in optical, thermal, microwave, and fluorescence frequencies. We conclude the review with an outlook of challenges and recommendations.

However, the spatial disparities of ES balance, along with its determinants and spillover effects, remain unclear, constraining effective ES management and landscape planning. The aim of this study was to fill these gaps by quantifying the ES balance in the restoring Loess Plateau using an expert-based ES matrix approach and by examining the spatial associations between ES balance and driving factors via an integrated regression approach. The results showed that the county-scale ES balance was closely related to the land-use composition and population density. Geographic locations of counties with ES surplus were mainly concentrated in mountainous areas with high proportions of woodland and grassland, while urbanized land and a high population density resulted in an ES deficit. Forest and grass regeneration, due to revegetation practices, alleviated ES deficits, while rapid urbanization and population growth aggravated ES imbalance. The integrated regression approach demonstrated that the ES balance and its dependencies (i.e., landscape metrics and population density) had remarkable spatial heterogeneity and spillover effects, which should be practically considered in localized ES management and landscape optimization. Excessive agricultural reclamation and urban expansion improved grain productivity and economic profits but deteriorated landscape fragmentation, further aggravating the ES deficit. In contrast, excessive revegetation practices promoted ecosystem restoration and improved ES surplus but threatened food security. Therefore, an appropriate balanced state should be maintained for sustainable ecosystem restoration through timely and efficient policy interventions and landscape optimization.","2021-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","148472","","","793","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deficit; Determinant; Integrated regression approach; Loess Plateau; Surplus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It includes three major layers: spatial aggregations including inter and intra aggregations, temporal aggregation, and a forecasting network. The main function of HetSPGraph is to learn the dynamic spatiotemporal correlations between the regions and to further predict the drought in different regions, based on which accurate drought forecasting can be achieved. Experimental forecasting results of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in China indicated that the HetSPGraph model outperformed the traditional baseline methods including the Long Short-Term Memory model (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network-LSTM (CNN-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN) and Geographic-Semantic-Temporal Hypergraph Convolutional Network (GST-HCN).

We found that urban parks were with average cooling distance of 166.17 ± 11.69 m, cooling intensity of 2.85 ± 0.28 °C, covering about five times park area. The cooling lapse was 3.97 ± 0.40 °C/km. The climate gentrification was related to different accessibility to park cooling area. Residents in the urban center had better access to park cooling range than those outside the second ring road. Housing prices went up near cooling range of urban parks. To abate climate gentrification, measures should be taken, such as improving parks’ cooling performance and building affordable houses.

Expanding the area of cashew plantations and increasing productivity are critical to improving the livelihood of many smallholder communities. As the third largest cashew producer in Africa, Benin has nearly 200,000 smallholder cashew growers contributing 15% of the country's national export earnings. Expansion of the cashew industry is thus an essential economic driver and a governmental priority in Benin. However, a lack of information on where and how cashew trees grow across the country hinders decision-making that could support increased cashew production and poverty alleviation. By leveraging 2.4-m Planet Basemaps and 0.5-m aerial imagery, two newly developed deep learning algorithms, and large-scale ground truth datasets, we successfully produced the first-of-its-kind national map of cashew in Benin and characterized the expansion of cashew plantations between 2015 and 2021. In particular, we developed a SpatioTemporal Classification with Attention (STCA) model to map the distribution of cashew plantations with 2.4-m multi-temporal Planet Basemaps from 2019 to 2021, which can fully capture texture information from discriminative time steps during a growing season. The U-Net model was employed to map the distribution of cashew plantation with 0.5-m mono-temporal aerial imagery in 2015, which can achieve accurate and fast predictions even with limited training data. We further developed a Clustering Augmented Self-supervised Temporal Classification (CASTC) model to distinguish high-density versus low-density cashew plantations by automatic feature extraction and optimized clustering. Results show that the STCA model has an overall accuracy over 85% based on 1400 ground truth point samples from each year. The CASTC model achieved an overall accuracy of 76% based on 348 ground truth samples of planting density. We found that the cashew area in Benin has almost doubled to 519 ± 20 kha from 2015 to 2021 with 60% of new plantation development coming from cropland or fallow land, while encroachment of cashew plantations into protected areas has increased by 55%. Only about half of cashew plantations were high-density in 2021, suggesting high potential for intensification. Our study illustrates the power of combining high-resolution remote sensing imagery and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to better understand tree crops in the heterogeneous smallholder landscape, which can help efficiently allocate limited training and nursery resources for sustainable agricultural development.","2023-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","113695","","","295","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cashew plantation; Deep learning; Planet Basemaps; Smallholder agriculture; Tree crop mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Earth Observation (EO) data provides high spectral, spatial and temporal data for various agricultural applications. However, mapping and monitoring small crop fields and complex landscapes are still challenging, in particular when attempting to trace the historical evolution of land use changes. To address this issue, a study was set up in the Udon Thani Province of Thailand, with small agricultural parcels and highly fragmented landscapes, covering an area of approximately 11,000 km2. Three decades of crop type dynamics were monitored and assessed using different combinations of multi-temporal Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat data and the random forest (RF) classifier. The combined multi-temporal EO datasets proved the most efficient for mapping crop types. Classification results achieved overall accuracy (OA) of 87.9%, 88.1%, 84.8% and 92.6% for the four base-years 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019, respectively. Thanks to the availability of high-quality reference labels, the crop type map of 2019 showed the highest overall and class-specific accuracies. The 2019 classification model separated many crop classes well, especially sugarcane, cassava, rice and para rubber. On the contrary, for 1989, 1999 and 2009 drops in accuracy had to be accepted, as direct field reference observations were unavailable and reference information had to be sourced through photo-interpretation or trimming approaches. Overall, however, the RF method together with multi-temporal EO satellite data from multiple platforms showed high potential and excellent efficiency in crop type classification in complex landscapes. The most dominant classes of crop types for the four base-years were rice, sugarcane, and cassava, respectively. Land cover changes indicated that transitions of 1,529 km2 (14%) occurred between 1989 and 1999, mainly as increase in sugarcane and rice areas. From 1999 to 2009, significant land changes were observed covering 2,340 km2 (21%), primarily as increased cassava and para rubber cultivation. During the most recent period 2009 to 2019, an additional 3,414 km2 (31%) were transformed, mainly through the expansion of para rubber and sugarcane plantations. The main drivers for the observed land use changes in the three decades were commodity prices and agricultural policies. The cost-efficiently derived results provide valuable information to inform land use management decisions of policymakers and other stakeholders, including the consideration of environmental aspects.","2022-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:31","2024-01-19 10:23:31","","107083","","","198","","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Crop type; Earth Observation; Landsat; Multi-temporal imagery; Post-classification change detection; Random Forest; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Remote sensing in general and satellite imagery more specifically are part of these technologies which can help provide accurate monitoring and classification of cultivars. Part of the increase in the use of these technologies has to do with the ongoing increment on the spatial–temporal resolution together with the free availability of some of these services. Typically time series are used as a pre-processing technique and combined with supervised learning techniques in order to build models for crop type identification in remote images. However, these models suffer from the lack of labelled data sets needed to train them. Unsupervised classification can overcome this limitation but has been less frequently used in this research field. This paper proposes to test and analyse the performance of several unsupervised clustering algorithms towards crop type identification on remote images. In this manner combinations of clustering algorithms and distance measures, a key element in the behaviour of these algorithms, are studied using an experimental design with more than twenty datasets built from the combinations of five crops and more than 45000 parcels.

Whereas the promise in explicitly linking geographical features to SES has been highlighted fairly clear in previous works, scholars hold an eclectic attitude in their outlook, given the absence of theoretical ground, the heavy reliance on nontransparent proprietary data sources and the relatively coarse resolution predictions. Drawing on a case study of Hangzhou metropolitan in China, this paper aims to address these problems by demonstrating a novel approach to neighborhood SES inference based on online housing advertisements. We first revisit the theoretical debates on the linkage between neighborhood SES and online housing advertisements. Then, the Naïve Bayes classifier is employed to semantically identify the topics from online housing advertisements and the associated sentiments are quantified using the lexicon-based approach. Following that, seven commonly used machine learning algorithms are compared and utilized to infer the fine-grained neighborhood SES at residential quarters scale based on the housing attributes and extracted topics from online housing advertisements. Results show that machine learning algorithms vary with predictive ability and the tree-based algorithms are much more powerful in inferring neighborhood SES. More specifically, we distinguish 8 reliable features which not only present relative high importance estimated by all the machine learning algorithms but also exhibit great robustness in inferring neighborhood SES and show promising potential to being applied for unraveling social inequalities. We also observe noteworthy spatial heterogeneity in neighborhood SES across the research site. The demonstrated approach not only enables the policymakers to take stock of deprived neighborhoods in a timely manner, but also lays firm ground for framing contextualized strategies of urban governance. This study is among the first attempts to bridge the theoretical interpretation of housing attributes with the proxy indicator -based approach for fine-grained neighborhood SES measurement.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:32","2024-01-19 10:23:32","","102572","","","124","","Habitat International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Area deprivation; Machine learning; Neighborhood socioeconomic status; Online housing listings; Open data; Social inequalities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to identify the LU/LC changing patterns of Rajshahi city for 2000, 2010 and 2020 and simulate future LU/LC changes for 2040. Multi-temporal cloud-free Landsat satellite images were used to estimate the LU/LC and urban settlement changing pattern using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques. A support vector machine algorithm was used to classify the LU/LC classes. All the classified LU/LC maps demonstrate excellent accuracy by showing more than 85% overall accuracy. The multi-layer perception Markov chain (MLP-MC) model was used to predict the future LU/LC scenario for 2040. Validation of the predicted LU/LC map demonstrated more than 90% overall accuracy. The study found that an average of 3.6 km2 urban settlements increased at 10 years interval by replacing the natural resources. The future prediction shows that more than 60% of the total city area will be transformed into urban settlements by 2040. The dramatic increase in urban settlements and reduction in green cover and water bodies will damage the environmental sustainability of Rajshahi city by increasing temperature and heatwaves. This study will help the urban planners and policymakers to make proper sustainable development decisions by understanding the LU/LC changing pattern.","2021-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:32","2024-01-19 10:23:32","","100148","","","4","","Environmental Challenges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Change detection; Land use/land cover; Remote sensing; Simulation; Urban settlements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposed a new processing pipeline to map potential wetlands in the Yangtze River Basin, the largest basin in China, by combining a random forest (RF) algorithm and an indicator system constituted by several indicators, including vegetation, soil, terrain, and climatic features. Results reveal that slope, annual precipitation (APRE), digital elevation model (DEM), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and annual mean temperature (AMT) are the most important variables affecting the distribution of potential wetlands, with a relative importance value of 7.5 %, 5.9 %, 5.5 %, 5.2 %, and 5.2 %, respectively. Mapping potential wetlands in the Yangtze River Basin was achieved using the RF model with overall accuracy of 79.31 % and Kappa coefficient of 0.58. The estimated total area of potential wetlands in this basin is approximately 39,677 km2, mainly distributed in the Yalong River watershed, the Dongting Lake watershed, and the regions bordering main streams of the Yangtze River. The proposed approach in this study evidenced its generalizability in terms of the good accuracy and distribution consistency with the natural wetlands observed from satellites and field investigation.

The green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in urban areas appears to be an important measure to enhance the economic benefits of the urban environment, but related research is still limited. In this article, we combine big data and machine learning methods to investigate the economic benefits of GBI in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province. Specifically, the daily travel routes of citizens are analyzed at two scale levels (the housing and neighborhood scales); in our analysis, we start with the structural attributes of citizens’ own houses, move on to the city street views that citizens walk through, pass by the locational amenities where citizens spend their leisure time, and arrive at open spaces located throughout the city. The above trajectory dataset includes 30 variables, which were used as the input into ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multiscale GWR (MGWR). The results show that MGWR (adj. R2 = 0.524 at the housing scale, while adj. R2 = 0.869 at the neighborhood scale) with all control variables and the GBI attribute variables have the highest goodness of fit: the closer GBI is to urban residents, the higher the economic benefits are regardless of the area; and the higher the street visible green rate is, the greater the economic benefits are. Therefore, urban areas can appropriately increase the number of well-designed small GBIs located near urban residents. Our research provides insights into how big data and machine learning can be employed in frameworks to characterize the economic benefits of GBI and can be applied in other countries and regions.","2021-09-20","2024-01-19 10:23:32","2024-01-19 10:23:32","","128321","","","316","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Economic benefits; Green and blue infrastructure (GBI); Hedonic price model (HPM); Human-scale; Multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas the floodplain received a lot of attention from the scientific community over the past years, little is known about the state of the entire catchment, in particular of its protected areas. We have evaluated how human impact – expressed here as land with specific anthropogenic land use (e.g. settlements, agricultural areas, teak plantations) – varies across the different protection categories (e.g. national park, game reserve, wildlife management area etc.). For that, first we used long-term land use/land cover (LULC) change maps of the Kilombero catchment to assess the human impact per protected area category. Second, we calculated building density per square kilometer as an indicator of existing human pressure. Third, from the anthropogenic LULC area in 2014 we predicted those areas that show similar morphometric, edaphic and bio-climatic conditions in the study region using the maximum-entropy algorithm (maxEnt). Results of the analysis reveal that in 2014 almost half of the Kilombero Ramsar site was covered by anthropogenic land uses, resulting in a share of 17% for all protected areas. Protected areas with strict use regulations such as national parks and game reserves showed virtually no anthropogenic land use throughout the observation period of 40 years (1974–2014), whereas LULC change was higher in unprotected areas. The increase of agricultural land was mainly at the expense of open woodland, floodplain grassland and savanna grassland. Our results further demonstrate that approx. 670.000 ha of the Kilombero catchment comprise similar conditions as the currently used land within the catchment. However, two thirds of it is located in protected areas, causing challenges for conservation. This is the first study exploring the effect of protected areas of the Kilombero catchment from a LULC and modeling perspective.","2020-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:32","2024-01-19 10:23:32","","41-55","","","168","","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anthropogenic land use; Conservation; Land suitability modeling; Land use/land cover change; maxEnt; Protected area","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined the long-term global normalised difference vegetation index during the baseline period (1982–2015) and found widespread greening in 70% of global vegetated areas in response to climate warming. However, climate change is not the only cause of global greening. The spatial variability in the response of global vegetation to environmental factors has not been well established. The Cubist model was used to investigate the relationship between peak vegetation growth and environmental variables. The results showed that 64% of the spatial variation in greening/browning can be explained by climate (including precipitation and temperature), followed by atmospheric components of nitrogen deposition and carbon dioxide concentration (17%), terrain properties (12%), and soil properties (7%). By incorporating future climate and atmospheric component projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 into the model, enhanced vegetation greening was predicted globally, particularly in evergreen needle-leaf forests and grasslands, from 2081 to 2100. Many browning changes were predicted in evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forests, mixed forests, and around areas influenced by human land use. Overall, these findings reveal that environmental factors have relevant integrated impacts on vegetation dynamics under climate change and should be considered during the design of local mitigation and adaptation management strategies.","2023-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:32","2024-01-19 10:23:32","","102031","","","75","","Ecological Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Environmental driver; Future scenario; Machine learning; Peak vegetation growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disease-specific factors revealing group structure and photosynthetic physiology contribute to high-precision monitoring for wheat stripe rust. In this study, we proposed a remote sensing model that collaborates wavelet features (WFs) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). First, sensitive features including vegetation indices (VIs), SIF parameters, WFs, and fractional-order derivative spectra (FODs) were screened based on correlation coefficient (CC) analysis and variable importance in projection (VIP). Then, through collaboration among features, six feature sets were received and imported to partial least squares regression (PLSR), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Finally, monitoring models was evaluated through two methods: holdout cross-validation and 5-fold cross validation to ascertain the optimal feature-algorithm combination. The results demonstrated that the collaboration of canopy SIF with any feature markedly improved the monitoring accuracy due to its responsive nature to the plant's photosynthetic physiology. The model based on XGBoost with WFs-SIF as input features achieved optimal monitoring accuracy, with at least 16.6% increase in R2 and 32.4% reduction in RMSE compared to the VIs-PLSR model. Correlation analysis of evaluation indexes (R2 and RMSE) under two cross-validation methods showed determination coefficients of 0.743 and 0.837, indicating mutual validation and high reliability of the conclusions. This study suggests that the collaboration between WFs and SIF exhibits considerable feasibility in high-precision monitoring of stripe rust, providing a novel insight for future field-scale diagnosis of crop diseases.","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","108366","","","215","","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Continuous wavelet transform; Fractional-order derivative; Remote sensing; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Stripe rust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are especially useful in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where landscapes are complex and farms are small, i.e. less than two ha. In this study, a hierarchical remote sensing approach was developed to estimate field fractions at 30 m spatial resolution in a highly fragmented agricultural region of Ethiopia. The landscape was stratified into crop production system (CPS) zones with ten-day SPOT Proba-V 1 km normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites. The CPS zones were used to disaggregate agricultural census statistics to 1 km field fractions and mask “wet” and “dry” seasons. Long-term average wet-dry season NDVI and topographic information derived from 30 m Landsat-8 (OLI) surface reflectance and the SRTM digital elevation model were combined with 1 km field fractions in a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to produce the field fractions. Sample dot grids were manually interpreted from very high-resolution DigitalGlobe imagery on the Google Earth platform for training and testing. The model yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.71 and R2 of 0.65 in the holdout sample set. The high AUC reveals the model was effective at classifying 30 m pixels as “crop” or “not crop” while the high R2 indicated leveraging at the extremes (100 and 0% probability), meaning at 30 m resolution, subpixel variations were difficult to discern. The improved model skill compared to previous cropland mapping studies using GAMs can be attributed to the stratification and decomposition of the Landsat time series using CPS-defined phenology. Additional remote sensing model inputs, such as Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 red-edge reflectance, could provide additional explanatory power. Wall-to-wall national coverage for agricultural production estimation or other food security related application could be achieved by manually digitizing additional sample data in other regions of Ethiopia or using existing crowd-sourced databases, such as Geo-Wiki.","2020-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","233-245","","","161","","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural production; GAMs; Landsat; Landscape stratification; NDVI; Proba-V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amazônia Legal has showed some declines in deforestation rates, but NW Amazonia has become one of the most recent/new hotspots of forest loss in the Amazon basin. Regional models of change are tools that support the analysis of causes and consequences in the dynamics of land use and are critical in the construction of scenarios for planning the future of the territory and conserving Amazonian forests. The neural networks implemented in the Terrset Land Change Modeler (LCM) module were used to predict and analyze the recent (2007–2016) and future business as usual (BAU2030) and two alternative scenarios for 2030 (PAST50_2030 AND TECH_2030) of the Colombian Amazon and prognostics for intact forests of the future. We used 5 main categories (forests, pastures, secondary vegetation, fragmented forests, and others) and grouped the main transitions of categories into three submodels of change (conversion to pastures, degradation and regeneration). The simulation foresees a substantial loss of forests in the business as usual scenario of 7.92% for 2030 (−3,387,898 ha), followed by a projected increase in pastures of 2,012,087 ha (52.5%) respectively. On the contrary the alternative scenarios show more reduced loss of forest for 2030 of 1,998,299 ha (4.6%) for the PAST50_2030 scenario and a 612,989 ha (1.4%) in the TECH_2030 scenario, accompanied of an increase of only 362,966 ha of pastures in the first case and a reduction of pastures of 316,705 ha in the TECH_2030 case. The most worrying projection is the reduction of intact forest from an average size of forest fragments of 5724 ha in 2016 to 1668 ha (BAU2030), 1744 ha (PAST50_2030) and a minor reduction to 2397 ha for the TECH_2030 scenario. There is also an increased isolation and a reduction of total forest core that only in the TECH_2030 scenario is less pronounced. The protection of those intact patches is key to the future of the NW Amazonia, the reduction in the rate of conversion to pastures PAST50_2030 indicates an opportunity to have a less dramatic loss of forest intact patches but the TECH_2030 scenario is where those areas remain less affected and connectivity will be less affected. These findings signal the urgent need to find mechanisms to implement effective planning in the region in order to prevent uncontrolled expansion, slow deforestation and fragmentation rates and to ensure the integrity of the protected areas and the connectivity of such key landscapes.","2019-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","e00567","","","17","","Global Ecology and Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Amazonia; Colombia; Forest loss; Fragmentation; Land use land cover; Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Next, Crichton's Risk Triangle framework, based on the hazard-exposure-vulnerability risk components, was employed to estimate heat-related health risks. Finally, the relationship between LCZ types and heat-related health risk levels was quantitatively analyzed in detail. The results indicated that at least 60% of LCZ1-5 (compact high-/mid-/low-rise, open high-/mid-rise areas) were designated as high-risk areas, while heat hazard mitigation and climate adaptation strategies in urban planning would benefit more from LCZ 6 (open low-rise). This study, based on the LCZ concept, shows the risk difference at the community level, and can be used for informing and implementing area-level urban planning strategies. It could contribute to global heat-related health risk analysis, since the LCZ is a globally consistent system for urban microclimate analysis.","2023-04-01","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","104402","","","91","","Sustainable Cities and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Heat-related health risk; Land surface temperature retrieval; Local climate zones; Mapping; Urban Heat Island effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite missions for the first time provide radar and optical data at high spatial and temporal detail, and with this a unique opportunity for more accurate wetland mapping from space arises. Recent studies already used Sentinel-1 and -2 data to map specific wetland types or characteristics, but for comprehensive wetland characterisations the potential of the data has not been researched yet. The aim of our research was to study the use of the high-resolution and temporally dense Sentinel-1 and -2 data for wetland mapping in multiple levels of characterisation. The use of the data was assessed by applying Random Forests for multiple classification levels including general wetland delineation, wetland vegetation types and surface water dynamics. The results for the St. Lucia wetlands in South Africa showed that combining Sentinel-1 and -2 led to significantly higher classification accuracies than for using the systems separately. Accuracies were relatively poor for classifications in high-vegetated wetlands, as subcanopy flooding could not be detected with Sentinel-1’s C-band sensors operating in VV/VH mode. When excluding high-vegetated areas, overall accuracies were reached of 88.5% for general wetland delineation, 90.7% for mapping wetland vegetation types and 87.1% for mapping surface water dynamics.

This leads to a lack of investment in network infrastructure, resulting in a phenomenon commonly referred to as the ‘digital divide’. In this paper we present a machine learning method that uses publicly available satellite imagery to predict telecoms demand metrics, including cell phone adoption and spending on mobile services, and apply the method to Malawi and Ethiopia. Our predictive machine learning approach consistently outperforms baseline models which use population density or nightlight luminosity, with an improvement in data variance prediction of at least 40%. The method is a starting point for developing more sophisticated predictive models of infrastructure demand using machine learning and publicly available satellite imagery.

We developed a methodology for the identification of FSTs using airborne laser scanning (ALS), and demonstrate its generality by applying it to forests from Boreal, Mediterranean and Atlantic biogeographical regions. First, hierarchal clustering analysis (HCA) was applied and clusters (FSTs) were determined in coniferous and deciduous forests using four forest structural variables obtained from forest inventory data – quadratic mean diameter (QMD), Gini coefficient (GC), basal area larger than mean (BALM) and density of stems (N) –. Then, classification and regression tree analysis (CART) were used to extract the empirical threshold values for discriminating those clusters. Based on the classification trees, GC and BALM were the most important variables in the identification of FSTs. Lower, medium and high values of GC and BALM characterize single storey FSTs, multi-layered FSTs and exponentially decreasing size distributions (reversed J), respectively. Within each of these main FST groups, we also identified young/mature and sparse/dense subtypes using QMD and N. Then we used similar structural predictors derived from ALS – maximum height (Max), L-coefficient of variation (Lcv), L-skewness (Lskew), and percentage of penetration (cover), – and a nearest neighbour method to predict the FSTs. We obtained a greater overall accuracy in deciduous forest (0.87) as compared to the coniferous forest (0.72). Our methodology proves the usefulness of ALS data for structural heterogeneity assessment of forests across biogeographical regions. Our simple two-tier approach to FST classification paves the way toward transnational assessments of forest structure across bioregions.","2019-02-15","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","111-121","","","433","","Forest Ecology and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Classification and regression trees; Forest structural types; LiDAR; Nearest neighbour imputation; Structural heterogeneity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These last are considered powerful management instruments able to help farmers achieve the best efficiency in irrigation water use and to increase their incomes through obtaining the highest possible crop yield. In this context, within the project “An advanced low cost system for farm irrigation support – LCIS” (a joint Italian-Israeli R&D project), a fully transferable DSS for irrigation support, based on three different methodologies representative of the state of the art in irrigation management tools (W-Tens, in situ soil sensor; IRRISAT®, remote sensing; W-Mod, simulation modelling of water balance in the soil-plant and atmosphere system), has been developed. These three LCIS-DSS tools have been evaluated, in terms of their ability to support the farmer in irrigation management, in a real applicative case study on maize grown on Andosols in a private farm in southern Italy in the 2018 season. The evaluation considered the predictive performance of the tools and also the pros and cons of their application, due their different spatial scale applicability, costs and complexity of use. The results have shown that all three approaches are able to realise the maximum obtainable maize production. However, the method based on in situ soil sensor (W-Tens) supplied 40% more water compared to the other two methods, whereas the IRRISAT® and W-Mod approaches represent the best solution in terms of irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, IRRISAT® has the advantage of being able to work without soil spatial information, although unlike W-Tens both the latter methods need a high level of user expertise and consequently support of external service providers. Integration between different tools represents an opportunity for improved water use efficiency in agriculture (e.g., field sensors and remote sensing).","2019-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","102646","","","176","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DSS for irrigation; Maize; Precision agriculture; Water use efficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite being an important agricultural centre, Brazil's semi-arid region is experiencing significant desertification. However, the relationship between land management and climate in this process is still poorly understood. This research was conducted in areas predominantly covered by the Caatinga Formation (62.2%), as well as agropastoral and pasture areas (29.9%). Our primary objective was to assess the land use change trajectories and land occupation patterns in the region while also analysing how vegetation and precipitation temporal patterns have changed from 1985 to 2019. The trends in vegetation and precipitation were evaluated using the Mann-Kendall test. Land use and occupation patterns were analysed using segmented regression and Monte Carlo simulation for future forecasting in the period 2020–240 under different scenarios (pessimistic, conservative, and optimistic). The Mann-Kendall test indicated that the precipitation trends were not statistically significant. However, the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) exhibited a significant trend in areas near the São Francisco River, an important agricultural area. Land use and occupation showed breakpoints from 1990 onwards for most classes. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the Caatinga Formation will likely to remain the predominant vegetation class in the region for the next 21 years in all predicted scenarios. Agropastoral and pasture classes are projected to increase by 8% and 3%, respectively, while the area covered by native vegetation is expected to decrease by 7.5%. Furthermore, the predictions showed a decline in the rivers and lakes class, which may result in significant economic and social problems. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of land use change in the Brazilian semi-arid region and provide science-based information for environmental public policies.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","102192","","","77","","Ecological Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Caatinga biome; Cabrobó; Land use change; Monte Carlo simulation; NDVI; Precipitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spatial predictions of AWC through digital soil mapping at high resolution and national extent provide relevant information for upscaling ecological and hydrological models, and assessment of the provision of ecosystem services like water quantity and quality regulation, carbon sequestration, and provision of food and raw materials. However, the spatial predictions of AWC are prone to errors and uncertainties. Moreover, this digital soil mapping process requires using pedotransfer functions (PTFs) due to the lack of sufficient georeferenced measurements of the upper (i.e., soil moisture at field capacity, θFC) and lower (i.e., soil moisture at permanent wilting point, θPWP) limits of soil moisture contents defining AWC. This adds an additional source of uncertainty to the final estimates of AWC. The objectives of this study were: 1) to predict AWC for mainland France following the GlobalSoilMap (GSM) project specifications on depth intervals and uncertainty, and 2) to quantify the uncertainty of AWC accounting for uncertainty of the soil input variables and the PTFs' coefficients. We first predicted the soil input properties by GSM layer (0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60, 60–100, 100–200 cm), and then applied PTFs for estimating θFC, θPWP, and volumetric AWC (cm3 cm−3). The volume of coarse elements by GSM layer was subtracted before aggregating AWC to estimated soil depth for a maximum of 2 m. The uncertainty of AWC was quantified by first-order Taylor analysis. Independent evaluation indicated that clay had the lowest R2 (clay R2 = 0.27, silt R2 = 0.43 and sand R2 = 0.46) and RMSE (clay RMSE = 128 g kg−1, silt RMSE = 139 g kg−1 and sand RMSE = 172 g kg−1) from the three particle size fractions. However, the model for coarse elements had the worst predictive performance (R2 = 0.14 and RMSE = 21%) among all AWC input variables. The performance of the GSM predictions for θFC and θPWP had a R2 of 0.21 and 0.29. When the PTFs were applied to the spatial predictions of sand and clay, the RMSE for θFC and θPWP had a relative increase of 25% and 36% respectively compared to when they were applied to measured horizon data. Across the majority of mainland France, the main sources of uncertainty of elementary AWC were coarse elements and soil texture, but the contribution of uncertainty of PTFs' coefficients increased in areas dominated by very sandy and clayey textures. An advantage of the produced maps of θFC, θPWP and AWC is that the end users can incorporate associated uncertainties into ecological and agricultural modelling, and decision-making processes involved in soil and water planning.","2019-06-15","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","14-30","","","344","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital soil mapping; Pedotransfer function; Soil available water capacity; Soil moisture at field capacity; Soil moisture at permanent wilting point","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assessment of land degradation is necessary for designing a mitigation plan that will reduce the adverse effects of land degradation. Recently, sensitivity models for analyzing land degradation have become a popular scientific tool for determining the spatial characteristics of this complicated environmental phenomenon. The objective of the current study is to prepare land degradation susceptibility maps for the gravely undulating red and lateritic agro-climatic zones (ACZ) of the Eastern plateau, India using hybrid techniques, i.e., integration of K-Fold cross-validation (CV) and machine learning algorithms of Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree) and the ensemble of Bagging-REPTree and Boosting-REPTree. For the modelling purpose, sixteen independent land degradation conditioning factors were selected based on a multi-collinearity test, and dependent factors, i.e., gully and ravine points, were collected from published reports and field investigations. The evaluation result of the models indicates that Boosting-REPTree is the most optimal in prediction analysis, as the area under the curve (AUC) of training and validation is 0.944 and 0.928, respectively, in K-Fold 1 followed by Bagging-REPTree and REPTree. As a result, this study suggested that the ensemble of the Boosting-REPTree model can be applied as a new potential method for spatial prediction of land degradation in future research. The study also revealed that ex-situ plant species had been adopted to control soil erosion. Still, it is considered a false measure as ex-situ plant species cannot prevent erosion to an optimal level.

It is crucial to grasp the distribution of soybean cultivation areas for ensuring food security, eradicating hunger and adjusting crop structures. However, the traditional method of extracting soybean planting areas drains on manpower and material resources and takes a long time. The emergence of high-resolution images, such as Sentinel-2A(S2A), enables the identification of soybean at the field scale, and these images can be applied on a large scale with the support of cloud computing technology. This work proposes a heterogeneous double ensemble algorithm to extract soybean planting area. The crop type dataset from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and S2A dataset are applied in this study. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) calculated from S2A data are used to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed method consists of the following steps. Firstly, the S2A data is processed according to phenological information and spectra characteristics. Secondly, the texture features obtained by the grayscale matrix are integrated with spectral features. Thirdly, in order to remove useless features and improve the classification efficiency, only important bands are retained for the next step through feature importance analysis. Fourthly, Random Forest (RF), Classification And Regression Tree (CART), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) serve as base classifiers to train the above-mentioned features. Finally, result maps are obtained by “voting” on three classification results. In this study, three research areas, Guthrie in Iowa, Clinton in Indiana, and Cuming in Nebraska are utilized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical simulations show the increased performance of classification when using these propositions. When compared with the reference methods, the average increase of the overall accuracy obtained by the proposed algorithm is 1.4%, 3.2%, and 1.7% on the Guthrie data, Clinton data, and Cuming data respectively.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","106955","","","197","","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ensemble learning; Feature analysis; Machine learning; Multi-spectral remote sensing; Soybean","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, three commonly used machine learning models for predicting global and diffuse solar radiation were assessed in eight Chinese cities, representing different geoclimatic and pollutant conditions. According to the results; regarding the nRMSE, nMAE, nMBE and R values, coastal locations (such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc.) obtained higher values than inland locations (such as Lanzhou and Wuhan). Moreover, the SVM (support vector machine) highly outperformed the other models in all locations, regardless of whether the study area was arid, semiarid, semihumid or humid, followed by GLMNET (generalized linear modeling) and RF (random forest). In addition, when assessing the SVM in different locations under different climatic and pollution conditions, it was indicated that the accuracy of solar radiation prediction was closely related to the weather and pollution condition levels. In general, the global solar radiation prediction error was in line with the weather condition levels. The prediction error increased as the weather level increased. However, the relationship between the pollution condition levels and the global solar radiation prediction showed a non-linear relationship. Moreover, for the prediction results of diffuse solar radiation, its variation law with different weather and pollution condition levels was almost different from that of global solar radiation. The maximum high error occurrence probability of global solar radiation and diffuse solar radiation appeared at pollution levels 5 and 1, respectively. Overall, the SVM model demonstrated its reliability in radiation prediction under slight pollution and stable weather conditions. This is crucial in locations with scarce meteorological data and can be used to optimize the selection of geographical locations for photovoltaic power station construction.","2022-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","896-906","","","187","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Diffuse solar radiation; Global solar radiation; Machine learning; Prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DSM has become the ultimate soil spatial representation framework due to its quantitative results, replicability, and uncertainty analysis. The present study aimed to map the probability distribution of the derived soil profiles (DSPs) of soil typological units (STUs). DSPs are statistical representation of the properties of the soil profiles belonging to STUs. STUs aggregate individual profiles into a group. The criteria used for grouping were homogeneity for World Reference Base (WRB) reference soil group (WRB-RSG), qualifiers (WRB-qu), and Soil Taxonomy particle size for the family classification (USDA-PS), and the belonging to a specific Soil Region. The European Soil Regions have been suggested as the primary grouping criteria for soil mapping at the European continental scale since they define continental-scale soilscapes, distinguished mainly by their climate and geology. To map DSPs, we firstly mapped STUs. The grouping criteria of STUs were mapped at 500 m spatial resolution, using a Neural Network trained on 18,707 georeferenced and analyzed soil profiles selected from the Italian national soil database. A 10% of the soil profiles were randomly sampled using a stratified sampling approach for validation. In particular, the procedure consisted of: i) mapping the grouping criteria WRB-RSG, WRB-qu, and USDA-PS, on a 500 m national grid, through Neural Network; ii) grouping soil profiles on the base of the combinations of grouping criteria (WRB-RSG, WRB-qu, USDA-PS, and Soil Regions) as mapped with the first step at each grid node, to produce a map of Soil Typological Units (STUs); iii) calculating statistics for the soil parameters of the groups of soil profiles created, to produce a map of Derived Soil Profiles (DSPs). DSPs statistics (average, standard deviation, and sample numerosity) were elaborated for the following parameters: soil rooting depth, pH (in water), soil organic carbon, clay, silt, sand, coarse fragments, and cation exchange capacity. The maps obtained were validated against the test set. The same test set was used for the comparison with the National benchmark map (Soils Map of Italy 1:1,000,000) and with the global scale SoilGrids at 250 m spatial resolution. The overall accuracy was 45.98% for the WRB-RSG map compared with the 30.74% of WRB-RSG as mapped with the Soil Map of Italy, and 28.79% as mapped with SoilGrids; 33.07% for WRB-qu compared with the 15.69% of WRB-qu as mapped with the Soil Map of Italy, and 12.45% as mapped with SoilGrids, and 45.48% for USDA-PS, not comparable with the National and Global benchmarks. Tau statistics showed a higher accuracy Kappa of our approach than in others, due to the unbalanced classes numerosity. The predictive ability in the validation of DSPs parameters resulted in a R2 of 0.35 for clay (0.16 with SoilGrids), 0.28 for sand (0.08 with SoilGrids), 0.18 for pH in water (0.21 with SoilGrids). The proposed approach produced harmonized soil type maps with higher accuracy than the previous generation of conventional field-based soil maps for the national benchmark and the calculation of the uncertainty. The STUs express variability of soil properties between groups so their knowledge might improve our understanding of the soil distribution, the planning of their management, monitoring, and the decisions for further surveys. A future challenge will be including more dynamic parameters in the criteria used to create STU, to help monitoring soil management effects.","2023-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:35","2024-01-19 10:23:35","","e00619","","","32","","Geoderma Regional","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Andosols; Calcisols; Luvisols; Phaeozems; Soil typological units; Uncertainty mapping; Vertisol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we identified urban growth and renewal years using a temporal segmentation approach. Then, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights through logical reasoning, using the reference height in 2020 and the identified changing years. We evaluated the derived dataset and analyzed the urban growth patterns (i.e., upward and outward) over the past three decades. The detected change years are reliable, with an overall accuracy of 88% (±1 year). Meanwhile, the reconstructed built-up height data showed good agreement with surveyed results (R2: 0.92), with a root mean square error of 2.87 m and a mean absolute error of 2.07 m. Most expanded built-up areas during 1990–2020 were located at the fringe of the central city, and about 16% experiencing multiple changes.

To improve model performance, a model-update method was implemented in the framework to update the model structure and parameters once more measured data were available. 120 paired records (an image from smartphone and a measured water turbidity value by standard turbidimeters for each record) were collected from rivers, lakes and ponds across China to evaluate the performance of the developed framework. Our cross-validation results revealed a well prediction of water turbidity with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) >0.87 (p<0.001) during the training period and NS>0.73 (p<0.001) during the validation period. The model-update method (in case of more measured data) for the developed Bayesian models in the framework resulted in a decreasing trend of model uncertainty and a stable mode fit. This study demonstrated a high value of the Bayesian-based framework in predicting water turbidity in a robust and easy manner.","2021-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","117406","","","202","","Water Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lake; Pond; River; Uncertainty; Water quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, program improvement in real reforestation projects is challenging, due to the conjunction of many different variables that mutually interact and feed back on each other inextricably. This study develops a comprehensive assessment framework for reforestation programs, for which technical and environmental information is gathered and related to indicators of performance in both the short- and mid-term. This assessment, tested on a case study, aimed to provide reliable end-results for survival and growth, revealed pitfalls in successful plantation establishment and taught us how to improve plantation performance and what the margin for this improvement was. The selected project was carried out on harsh site conditions, with different species, cultivation treatments and contractors, and was affected by the driest year on record. Plantation mortality was high and increased progressively over time, particularly in the short-term when the rate was 53% (rising to 83% after ten years), showing high variation between sites and species (Pinus pinaster and Quercus faginea died more than 94% after ten years while Junipus phoenicea only 40%). All the hardwoods and the juniper showed lower growth rate after ten years (average stem volume < 40 cm3) than pines (stem volume > 470 cm3). Technical variables (project planning and execution) had a relatively important impact on plantation performance in the first two years (11–29%), but decreased with time, whilst environmental variables (site and meteorological) were more important ten years after planting (>50%). In the short-term, soil moisture and meteorology during the planting season were identified as key factors that triggered the effects of both technical decisions (planting date and planting technique) and other environmental variables on performance. In the design phase, some decisions related to zoning, species selection and cultural treatments were related to poor performance. The results provide practical information and guidelines about all potential drivers of plantation performance and contribute to identify those aspects more related to success of forest restoration in Mediterranean drylands.","2021-11-20","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","148952","","","796","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Boosted regression trees model; Ecosystem restoration; Establishment; Growth; Restoration improvement; sp.; Survival","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about the spatial and temporal variability of soil organic carbon (SOC), future trends, and the driving forces of changes in each Mollisols region. The aim of this work is to trace the SOC dynamics during the 2000–2020 period and forecast its dynamics for 2020–2040 period (every 5 years) across the global Mollisols regions, highlighting the driving factors for these changes. We used bare soil images and environmental covariates to construct a robust prediction model of SOC using machine learning. The best model was used to forecast future changes in SOC content under different emission scenarios. Also, the role of different predictor variables in predicting and driving SOC changes is indicated with the help of the shapley value algorithm. Results show that SOC content in the current global Mollisols regions is 26.45 g kg−1 in Ukraine, 21.34 g kg−1 in Northeast China, 21.05 g kg−1 in the USA and 15.59 g kg−1 in Argentina. However, they have been decreasing since 2001 and showed a slowing trend, with the highest and lowest rates of 11.45% in Ukraine and 7.33% in the USA, respectively. The forecast under different climate scenarios shows a slight decrease in SOC content within a range of 0.46%–1.22%. Among them, SSP 245 is more consistent with the current trend of SOC content, while SSP585 indicates the greatest loss of SOC content. Results revealed that the driving factors for SOC prediction in descending order were meteorologic, parent material, terrain and vegetation. All soil and meteorology variables contributed by 71%, while soil texture fractions and temperature were the top 20% of these variables. The main factors driving SOC changes from high to low latitudes are temperature, precipitation, and vegetation. It can be concluded that the temporal transfer model is a powerful tool to trace and forecast the dynamics of SOC in Mollisols regions at the global scale, enabling a clear understanding and ranking the factors affecting this process under diverse climate conditions.","2023-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","138544","","","421","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Global Mollisols regions; Soil conservation policies; Soil organic carbon (SOC); Trace and forecast","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nexus between digitalization and sustainability unfolds exciting opportunities in addressing global challenges, creating a just and sustainable society and laying the groundwork for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Several studies have reviewed the link between these two paradigms and how they mutually impact one another. However, most of these reviews are qualitative and manual literature reviews that are prone to subjectivity and so lacking the required rigor. Given the above, this study aims to provide a comprehensive and objective review of the knowledge base on how digitalization and sustainability actually and potentially contribute to each other and highlight the key research that links these two megatrends. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis of academic literature is conducted to objectively visualize the research status quo across time, disciplines, and countries. The Web of Science (WOS) database was searched for relevant publications published between January 1, 1900, and October 31, 2021. The search returned 8629 publications, of which 3405 were identified as primary documents pertaining to the study presented below. The Scientometrics analysis identified prominent authors, nations, organizations, prevalent research issues and examined how they have evolved chronologically. The critical review of results reveals four main domains in research on the nexus of sustainability and digitalization including Governance, Energy, Innovation, and Systems. The concept of Governance is developed within the Planning and Policy-making themes. Energy relates to the themes of emission, consumption, and production. Innovation has associated with the themes of business, strategy, and values & environment. Finally, systems interconnect with networks, industry 4.0, and the supply chain. The findings are intended to inform and stimulate more research and policy-making debate on the potential interconnection between sustainability and digitization, particularly in the post-COVID-19 era.","2023-05-01","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","e15172","","5","9","","Heliyon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digitalization; Scientometric analysis; Smart cities; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study selected Qinghai Province of China as the study area and intended to make such an attempt to fill this gap in terms of the following aspects: (1) analyzing the spatial patterns and changing trends of ten ESs (food supply, water supply, carbon sink, soil retention, sand fixation, hydrological regulation, flood mitigation，cultural service，net primary productivity, and habitat quality) in Qinghai Province from 2000 to 2018; (2)constructing a multi-level index system of human well-being under the framework of the SDGs, and setting the criteria to assess the level of local human well-being; and (3) building a structural equation model to explore the direct and indirect impacts of the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs on actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being. The findings revealed that: (1) most of the ecosystem services fluctuated with significant downward or upward trends during 2000–2018, except for four ESs (i.e., carbon sink, soil retention, flood mitigation, and habitat quality); (2) only a few indicators of local residents' well-being such as meat production, milk production, the numbers of medical technical personnel in hospitals and health centers, and the numbers of scientific and technical personnel met the SDG criteria in most time, while other indicators remained at low levels and there were large gaps between them and the SDG criteria; (3) actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were affected by the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs with different degrees directly or indirectly.

However, lumped recharge estimation models based on groundwater level variations are uncertain, and successful applications are known to depend on both climate and hydrogeological setting. Here, we assess the suitability of three different models to estimate recharge (Metran - Transfer Function-Noise model, AquiMod - groundwater level driven hydrological model, and GARDÉNIA - lumped catchment model). New hydrological insights Results showed that while all three models generally did well during the modelling of groundwater heads, the resulting recharge estimations from the models were different. The analysis showed that the transfer-noise modelling of groundwater heads with recharge and evapotranspiration in Metran is not generally applicable for recharge estimation. The addition of physical information in AquiMod improved the recharge estimations, but the reliability was still limited without control of the water balance due to non-uniqueness. By adding discharge information to the modelling, GARDÉNIA can provide more reliable recharge values. Thus, recharge estimation from groundwater head time series without water balance information must be considered uncertain with low precision, but applicability can be improved when including knowledge of the local system.","2023-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","101399","","","47","","Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Europe; Groundwater recharge; Lumped modelling; Time series analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the ecological maintenance status of Pingtan Island, Songming County (China), and Yoshkar-Ola (Russia) was studied from the perspective of ecological environment quality and ecological security pattern. The remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) was used to study the ecological environment quality, and the geographic detector was used to analyze the impact of six factors on RSEI. The random forest algorithm was used to classify land use from remote sensing images, and an ecological security pattern was constructed based on the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. The results show that the overall ecological maintenance of Pingtan Island is moderate, which accounts for 32.46% of the total area. The explanatory power of the dryness factor, which is the most influential factor on ecological environmental quality, increased by 3.90% during the five years, and the ecological corridor increased by 8.67 km. Songming County accounted for 33.66% of the area with moderate ecological maintenance. The dryness factor which affects the ecological environment quality is changed into the greenness factor, and its explanatory power has decreased by 3.59%, and the ecological corridor has increased by 57.95 km. Yoshkar-Ola accounted for 28.47% of the area with moderate ecological maintenance. The explanatory power of the dryness factor, which is the biggest factor affecting ecological environment quality, increased by 2.69% during the five-year period, and the length of the ecological corridor increased by 10.64 km.

In this study, we employ the Analytical Hierarchic Process-based Multi-Criteria Decision-Making approach together with geospatial inputs/methods to assess land suitability for betel leaf cultivation in Tamluk Subdivision of Purba Medinipur district in West Bengal, India. Seventeen individual parameters grouped into five categories – physiographic, land use and land cover, climatic, pedologic and infrastructural – were used. The respective ranks of the influencing factors were assigned based on collated farmer responses and expert opinions obtained during an extensive field survey, while a pair-wise comparison matrix was used to calculate their respective weights. Internal variations within individual factors were categorized by assigning scores based on their importance to betel leaf production, as ascertained from published literature and fieldwork. Results show that only 6.86% of the region is highly suitable and available for betel leaf cultivation, 30.15% area is moderately suitable, while 11.26% is marginally suitable but can be enhanced through apt land/water management practices. A 500 × 500 m grid overlay further elicited location specific combinations of the different land suitability classes and the presence/absence of waterbodies required for irrigation. It also ascertained the locational aptness of current betel leaf plots while identifying new expansion sites for this crop on the basis of grids having more than 40% of suitable lands with available water resources. The study presents possibly the first documentation of land suitability specifically for betel vine plots in Eastern India and thus thus provides a valuable insight into this high-value cash crop agribusiness, which can be useful for framing crop-specific policies.

Utilising geodata can contribute significantly to measuring financial access and thus assist in improving Financial Inclusion by expanding the reach of services and locating areas of economic exclusion. This study presents a new Spatial Decision Support System, with a frontend embedded directly within a spreadsheet interface, that enables measuring and planning financial access through geospatial analysis and Earth Observation derived products. The purpose is to complement existing Financial Inclusion measures, which rely significantly on large-scale representative household surveys to quantify financial access and opportunity to proxy quality of inclusion. The Decision Support System relies on Earth Observation and Public Participatory GIS, which enables a decoupling from the census cycle and global reach. Our findings indicate that a geospatial approach to measuring and making decisions regarding the location of financial access points can positively affect both tracking and delivering Financial Inclusion and reducing the urban–rural service cliff-edge. Our proposed geospatial methodology is useful for decision-makers in two ways: a) It allows the measurement of the large-scale geospatial reach of financial services – useful for decision-makers, planners, politicians, national statistical offices, and NGOs in charge of tracking progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. b) It helps with planning and optimising services for local financial entities such as mobile money agents, brick and mortar bank branches, and less formal saving mechanisms such as saving clubs.

It utilises data generated from traditional as well as new and emerging sources of urban data. The SUDS deploys geospatial technology, synthetic small area urban metrics, and cloud computing to enable urban analytics, and geovisualization with the goal of deriving actionable knowledge for better urban management and data-driven urban decision making. At the core of the system is a programme of urban indicators generated by using novel forms of data and urban modelling and simulation programme. SUDS differs from other similar systems by its emphasis on the generation and use of regularly updated spatially-activated urban area metrics from real or near-real time data sources, to enhance understanding of intra-city interactions and dynamics. By deploying public transport, labour market accessibility and housing advertisement data in the system, we were able to identify spatial variations of key urban services at intra-city levels as well as social and economically-marginalised output areas in major cities across the UK. This paper discusses the design and implementation of SUDS, the challenges and limitations encountered, and considerations made during its development. The innovative approach adopted in the design of SUDS will enable it to support research and analysis of urban areas, policy and city administration, business decision-making, private sector innovation, and public engagement. Having been tested with housing, transport and employment metrics, efforts are ongoing to integrate information from other sources such as IoT, and User Generated Content into the system to enable urban predictive analytics.","2019-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","456-473","","","98","","Future Generation Computer Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Small area assessment; Spatial big data; Spatial urban indicators; Urban analytics; Urban big data infrastructure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our motivation is to develop a cost-effective and scalable infrastructure to monitor shallow aquifers in regions where handpumps are already part of water infrastructure, but where traditional sources of groundwater monitoring data may be limited or non-existent. The data is generated using accelerometer sensors attached to the handles of nine handpumps in the study site in Kenya, instrumented for a year. These time-series data from handpumps are individually modelled using machine learning methods to track the changes in the water level with respect to the bottom of the rising main. Results show promise in modelling handpump vibration data with machine learning approaches to provide useful aquifer monitoring information from the “accidental infrastructure” of community handpumps. This technology is intended to complement existing hydrogeological modelling, and one of our key future goals is to integrate these machine learning outputs with hydrogeological information to develop more refined and robust models for shallow aquifer monitoring.","2020-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","100057","","","8","","Journal of Hydrology X","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aquifer monitoring; Handpumps; LSTM; Machine learning; Novel techniques; Water column","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A successful response to land degradation requires understanding its causes, impacts, and extent. It is also essential to recognize the effects of climate, soil, water, land cover, and socioeconomic factors on land degradation. Therefore, assessing land degradation risk can help prevent and reverse land degradation trends, especially for the main grain production area. The Environmental Sensitivity Area Index (ESAI) was used to identify land degradation sensitive areas in the North China Plain and combined with a random forest model to determine the main drivers affecting land degradation and predict future land degradation sensitive areas. The results show decreasing land degradation risk in the North China Plain. In 2015, the sensitivity of land degradation in the North China Plain had improved. The proportion of land area with high sensitivity to land degradation reduced to 0.02%. Combining the spatial and temporal distribution of ESAI and the prediction results of the random forest model, we know that socio-economic factors have the most significant impact on land degradation sensitivity. Although the risk of land degradation is decreasing, it is still necessary to pay attention to the possible future land degradation risk to stabilize food production. Assessing land degradation risk in North China Plain provides important decision information for rational and sustainable land management and has more vital practical significance.","2022-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","106766","","","183","","Ecological Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Environmental sensitive area index; Land degradation; NDVI; North China Plain; Random forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The outcomes represent the potential sensitivity of natural aquifers to leaching of dissolved compounds from the land surface. The study, developed at continental scale but retaining regionally a high resolution, is based on a critical application of the DRASTIC method. The biggest challenge in performing such a study in South America was the scattered and irregular nature of environmental datasets. Accordingly, the most updated information on soil, land use, geology, hydrogeology, and climate at continental, national, and regional scale were selected from international and local databases. To avoid spatial discrepancy and inconsistency, data were integrated, harmonized, and accurately cross-checked, using local professional knowledge where information was missing. The method was applied in a GIS environment to allow spatial analysis of raw data along with the overlaying and rating of maps. The application of the DRASTIC method allows to classify South America into five vulnerability classes, from very low to very high, and shows an overall medium to low vulnerability at continental scale. The Amazon region, coastal aquifers, colluvial Andean valleys, and alluvial aquifers of main rivers were the areas classified as highly vulnerable. Moreover, countries with the largest areas with high aquifer vulnerability were those characterized by extended regions of rainforest. In addition, a single parameter sensitivity analysis showed depth to water table to be the most significant factor, while a cross-validation using existing vulnerability assessments and observed concentrations of compounds in groundwater confirmed the reliability of the proposed assessment, even at regional scale. Overall, although additional field surveys and detailed works at local level are needed to develop effective water management plans, the present DRASTIC map represents an essential common ground towards a more sustainable land-use and water management in the whole territory of South America.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","153748","","","823","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DRASTIC; GIS; Groundwater; High-resolution maps; Intrinsic groundwater vulnerability; South America","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that the population spatialization result of the convolutional neural network model has the highest accuracy, and the average relative error is 24.4%; the accuracy of the deep neural network model is slightly higher than that of the random forest model but lower than that of the GPW dataset. The spatialization results of all the models are better than those of the WorldPop dataset.

Multi-temporal Landsat images were used within the Python module for the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model to calculate rice ETa and CWP during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. Results showed noticeable spatial variations in PySEBAL-derived ETa and CWP in farmers’ fields during the study period. The distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet (DPSI), plot elevation, sand and silt contents, soil total nitrogen, soil extractable potassium and zinc were the main factors affecting variabilities in ETa and CWP in the farmers’ fields, with DPSI being the top explanatory variable. There was generally a positive association, up to a given threshold, between ETa and DPSI, sand and silt contents and soil extractable zinc. For CWP the association patterns for the top six predictors were all non-monotonic; that is a mix of increasing and decreasing associations of a given predictor to either an increase or a decrease in CWP. Our results indicate that improving irrigated rice performance in the Kou Valley irrigation scheme would require growing more rice at lower altitudes (e.g. < 300 m above sea level) and closer to the scheme inlet, in conjunction with a good management of nutrients such as nitrogen and potassium through fertilization.","2023-03-31","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","108124","","","278","","Agricultural Water Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Irrigation performance; Machine learning; Soil property; Sub-Sahara Africa; Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL); Sustainable agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forest canopy density (FCD) is a useful measure to assess the forest cover change in its own as numerous works of forest change have been done using only FCD with the help of remote sensing and GIS. The coupling of binary logistic regression (BLR), random forest (RF), ensemble of rotational forest and reduced error pruning trees (RTF-REPTree) with FCD makes it more convenient to find out the deforestation probability. Advanced vegetation index (AVI), bare soil index (BSI), shadow index (SI), and scaled vegetation density (VD) derived from Landsat imageries are the main input parameters to identify the FCD. After preparing the FCDs of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017 the deforestation map of the study area was prepared and considered as dependent parameter for deforestation probability modelling. On the other hand, twelve deforestation determining factors were used to delineate the deforestation probability with the help of BLR, RF and RTF-REPTree models. These deforestation probability models were validated through area under curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristics (ROC), efficiency, true skill statistics (TSS) and Kappa co-efficient. The validation result shows that all the models like BLR (AUC = 0.874), RF (AUC = 0.886) and RTF-REPTree (AUC = 0.919) have good capability of assessing the deforestation probability but among them, RTF-REPTree has the highest accuracy level. The result also shows that low canopy density area i.e. not under the dense forest cover has increased by 9.26% from 1990 to 2017. Besides, nearly 30% of the forested land is under high to very high deforestation probable zone, which needs to be protected with immediate measures.","2020-08-15","2024-01-19 10:23:36","2024-01-19 10:23:36","","139197","","","730","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deforestation; Ensemble model; Forest canopy density; Machine learning algorithms; Probabilistic model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, in several low- and middle-income countries, census information may be unreliable, outdated or unsuitable for spatial analysis at the intra-urban level, which poses severe limitations in the development of urban population maps of adequate quality. To address these shortcomings, we deploy a novel framework utilizing multisource Earth Observation (EO) information such as Sentinel-2 and very-high-resolution Pleiades imagery, openly available building footprint datasets, and deep learning (DL) architectures, providing end-to-end solutions to the production of high quality intra-urban population distribution maps in data scarce contexts. Using several case studies in Sub-Saharan Africa, namely Dakar (Senegal), Nairobi (Kenya) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), our results emphasize that the combination of DL and EO data is very potent and can successfully capture relationships between the retrieved image features and population counts at fine spatial resolutions (100 meter). Moreover, for the first time, we used state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods to predict population distributions in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi (R2 = 0.39, 0.60) that did not require national census or survey data from Kenya or Tanzania, but only a sample of training locations from Dakar.

Modern methods of gully erosion measurement are typically derived from earlier techniques that have since become outdated. The increasing capabilities of technology had led to new ways of quantifying soil erosion processes (e.g. gully erosion) which must be used in erosion assessment. A tool designed to assess coastal erosion – Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), is applied to the analysis of gully erosion. To assess the usefulness of this technique, three different types of gullies were chosen (dendritic, linear, and linear that became dendritic) from the Moldavian Plateau of Romania were chosen. Different parameters (SCE, EPR, NSM, and LRR) were tested and analysed. The best results were obtained in the case of dendritic gullies with specific adjustments to the processing values (smoothing distance set to >1000 and transect spacing at values >5 m). In the case of linear gullies, the smoothing distance needs to be set to lower values compared to dendritic gullies (<= 1000). When it comes to the linear gully that evolved into a dendritic gully, the recommendation is to use smoothing distances with high values (>1000) and transect spacing values >10 m. The average erosion rates obtained with the help of DSAS are very close to the ones from the literature of gully erosion on the Moldavian Plateau in Romania (over – 1.5 m/yr and under – 1 m/yr for gullies cut in sandy and clay deposits, respectively). This leads us to the conclusion that the DSAS tool is “fit” for gully erosion assessment. However, like any other software, it has limitations and possible disadvantages. The tool can be successfully used and applied in the field of soil erosion mitigation, disaster risk reduction, environmental and cultural heritage protection and in reaching the UNSDG.","2021-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:37","2024-01-19 10:23:37","","105307","","","203","","CATENA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cultural heritage; Digital shoreline analysis system; Gully erosion; Moldavian Plateau; Monitoring; North-eastern Romania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a consequence, harmful algae blooms (HABs) are intensifying their occurrence in many aquatic ecosystems around the world. Under this water quality risk scenario, long term monitoring arises as a need to recognize, understand and anticipate the HABs outbreaks. However, existing monitoring methodologies are limited when dealing with HABs, thus forcing to make assumptions and decisions based on interpolated and inconsistent data. This conceptual paper attempts to highlight the importance of moving towards an integrated water monitoring methodology, where manual sampling, on-site automatic high-frequency monitoring (AHFM) and remote sensing are aligned to facilitates decision-making. In addition, because of the key role of microbial communities on the drift of aquatic ecosystems and water quality, they should be considered as a key element in HABs monitoring and management programs. In this manner, the biotic knowledge could be integrated into coordinated response plans as ecosystem management tools. Therefore, this holistic approach could provide decision makers and stakeholders an adaptive water resource management grounded on the theory of ecohydrology.","2021-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:37","2024-01-19 10:23:37","","549-554","","3","21","","Ecohydrology & Hydrobiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we present possible applications of UAVs to map and monitor three representative coastal tropical habitats: mangroves, rocky shores and coral reefs. We conducted UAVs surveys in a Marine Protected Area (MPA) of the tropical eastern Pacific region to investigate the suitability and usefulness of using this tool in a remote area for a variety of management and monitoring purposes. For mangrove ecosystems, we evaluated the potential of UAV-derived data to estimate canopy cover. On an intertidal rocky shore, we evaluated the potential of UAVs to obtain a detailed relative topographic position index that can be used to correlate the distribution patterns of resident and transient fauna. Finally, we compared the standard diver-based coral reef mapping approach used at the MPA with the use of a map produced with the UAV. Our results suggest that the use of UAVs by conservation practitioners in MPAs with diverse habitats, such as in the tropics, is likely to improve the knowledge of the MPAs environments and provide highly detailed information for monitoring helping to understand the nursery function of these inter-connected tropical habitats, at a reduced cost. This tool, therefore, has the potential to support conservation measures in a more effective way.","2019-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:37","2024-01-19 10:23:37","","108282","","","239","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal monitoring; Colombia; Coral reef mapping; Drones; Intertidal topographical complexity; Mangrove cover; MPAs; Tropical eastern pacific","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analysed results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 to inform cancer control planning efforts globally. Methods The GBD 2019 comparative risk assessment framework was used to estimate cancer burden attributable to behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risk factors. A total of 82 risk–outcome pairs were included on the basis of the World Cancer Research Fund criteria. Estimated cancer deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2019 and change in these measures between 2010 and 2019 are presented. Findings Globally, in 2019, the risk factors included in this analysis accounted for 4·45 million (95% uncertainty interval 4·01–4·94) deaths and 105 million (95·0–116) DALYs for both sexes combined, representing 44·4% (41·3–48·4) of all cancer deaths and 42·0% (39·1–45·6) of all DALYs. There were 2·88 million (2·60–3·18) risk-attributable cancer deaths in males (50·6% [47·8–54·1] of all male cancer deaths) and 1·58 million (1·36–1·84) risk-attributable cancer deaths in females (36·3% [32·5–41·3] of all female cancer deaths). The leading risk factors at the most detailed level globally for risk-attributable cancer deaths and DALYs in 2019 for both sexes combined were smoking, followed by alcohol use and high BMI. Risk-attributable cancer burden varied by world region and Socio-demographic Index (SDI), with smoking, unsafe sex, and alcohol use being the three leading risk factors for risk-attributable cancer DALYs in low SDI locations in 2019, whereas DALYs in high SDI locations mirrored the top three global risk factor rankings. From 2010 to 2019, global risk-attributable cancer deaths increased by 20·4% (12·6–28·4) and DALYs by 16·8% (8·8–25·0), with the greatest percentage increase in metabolic risks (34·7% [27·9–42·8] and 33·3% [25·8–42·0]). Interpretation The leading risk factors contributing to global cancer burden in 2019 were behavioural, whereas metabolic risk factors saw the largest increases between 2010 and 2019. Reducing exposure to these modifiable risk factors would decrease cancer mortality and DALY rates worldwide, and policies should be tailored appropriately to local cancer risk factor burden.

In the Sahel area, such information is valuable for risk management and mitigation in challenging sectors like food security, flood control, and urban planning. Due to its uniform quality across large areas in regular time steps, remote sensing imageries are essential input for producing land use maps. However, spatially and temporally heterogeneous landscapes in Sahel make classification of landscape features difficult. Our overall goal is to create an accurate, high resolution land use map covering Niamey, the capital of Niger and its surroundings which represents the unique landscape features in the Sahel using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 archives. We assessed the performance of three commonly used classifiers (i.e. Maximum Likelihood (ML), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)) for land use classification. To understand the utility of different features from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for classification, we performed feature selection and compared mapping accuracies with and without feature selection. To leverage the strength of each classifier, we developed a classifier ensemble (CE) map based on the mapping accuracy of each land use class and each classifier. The results of this study showed that the performance of individual classifiers depends on feature selection method and accuracies can be improved by combining different classifiers. The ensemble map had an overall accuracy of 72 ± 3.9% and it was found superior in terms of accuracy particularly with respect to built-up areas compared to the existing global land cover products in the study area. Our classification scheme also better characterized the regional environment in the Sahel. For example, we mapped rice and bare rocks that have important regional implication, which are not included in the existing products. Overall, our approach highlights the potentiality of combining multi-modal imageries and multiple classifiers for mapping a heterogenous environment such as the Sahel with high spatial resolution.","2021-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:37","2024-01-19 10:23:37","","97-111","","","178","","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Classifier ensemble; Feature selection; Land cover; Seasonal change; West Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increase in global population, it is projected that the quality of the water resources will deteriorate. Quantitative information on the state of water quality is quite crucial in water resources planning and conservation. Conventional or ground-based measuring tools are more time demanding, expensive for monitoring water quality parameters of inland water bodies, resulting in incomprehensive coverage in time and space. Due to the paucity of images with fine spatial and temporal resolution like Sentinel 2, provides invaluable information at a fine spatial scale for water quality monitoring to supporting progress towards achieving Sustainable Developments Goals (SDGs). This study quantified the spatial and temporal variations of water quality parameters of Total Nitrogen (TN), Turbidity, Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Matter (TSS) derived from cloud free and remotely sensed Sentinel 2 satellite data for a period from 2017 to 2022 for Lake Manyame in Zimbabwe. Furthermore, the research developed empirical models based on the linear regression between in-situ water sample data and water quality indicators of Sentinel 2. The results showed that between 2017 and 2022, the water quality in Lake Manyame significantly fluctuated. The regression coefficients (R²) between remote sensed water quality parameters and field or sample water data ranged from  R² = 0.63 to  R² = 0.95, providing a promising possibility for operational use of freely available remote sensing data in water quality monitoring in data constrained countries.The study demonstrated the importance and capability of using freely available Sentinel 2 data, with fine spatial and temporal resolution in providing invaluable information and evaluating on the state and indicators of water quality in inland water bodies in space and time.

Here we investigate for the first time recent global SOC changes, based on some SOC stock interannual data that were processed for the 2001–2015 period on a planetary scale. We analysed the global SOC dynamics using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator, which are widely acknowledged to be reliable geostatistical tools for detecting various environmental trends from global to local scale. We explored SOC changes via three metrics (averages, quantities, areas) of negative and positive trends, but also of the balance between soil carbon trends, a key statistic for monitoring land quality stability and soil–atmosphere carbon fluxes in the global environmental policies. Globally, we estimated a net average decrease of −58.6 t C km2 yr−1, a total loss of ~3.1 Pg C, and an area affected by net SOC losses of ~1.9 million km2. Using this triple statistic, we found that 79% of countries worldwide have been affected by net declines of SOC after 2001, which suggests that halting land degradation and mitigating climate change through the SOC pathway are still far from being achieved by international policies.","2021-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:38","2024-01-19 10:23:38","","111580","","","201","","Environmental Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Balance of trends; Climate change mitigation; Global analysis; Land degradation neutrality; Negative trends; Positive trends; Soil organic carbon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research aims to discern the success of sustainability planning by examining and comparing the different characteristics of UHIs through the combination of machine learning and statistical methods. To achieve this, we analyze 4 new towns in Korea, which include two ‘old’ new towns and two ‘recent’ new towns. The key difference between our test towns lies on whether or not the sustainability policies were applied to their development plans. We visualize LST and conduct a k-mean clustering to find and quantify spatial patterning in the resulting UHI measures. We then compare the statistical relations between LST and 6 UHI driven variables across the towns. Using comparative analysis, this research reveals that sustainable development policies have a notable effect on the patterns and intensities of UHI. Urban structures, planned under development policies, including green and blue space ratios, road networks, and housing distributions, were found to affect UHI significantly. We quantifiably confirm that the sustainability policies implemented in planning the ‘recent’ new towns allow the towns to experience less aggravated UHIs than the ‘old’ new towns. However, we also claim a need to develop appropriate, long-term UHI management regulations for the ‘recent’ new towns. This paper provides a solid basis for improving Korean new town planning and managing the environmental issues in urban systems for planners, designers, and decision-makers to establish the sustainable built environment.","2020-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:38","2024-01-19 10:23:38","","102341","","","61","","Sustainable Cities and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","K-mean clustering; Korean new towns; Land surface temperatures (LST); Remote sensing; Surface urban heat islands (SUHI); Sustainable planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the great spatial heterogeneity of soils, it is widely recognized that more representative soil observations are needed for better capturing the soil spatial variation and thus to increase the accuracy of digital soil maps. In reality, the budget for the field work and soil laboratory analysis is commonly limited due to its high cost and low efficiency. In the last two decades, being an alternative to wet chemistry, soil spectroscopy, such as visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR), mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy has been developed in measuring soil information in a rapid and cost-effective manner and thus enable to collect more soil information for digital soil mapping (DSM). However, spectroscopically inferred (SI) data are subject to higher uncertainties than reference laboratory analysis. Many DSM practices integrated SI data with soil observations into spatial modelling while few studies addressed the key question that whether these non-errorless soil data improve map accuracy in DSM. In this study, French Soil Monitoring Network (RMQS) and Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey Soil (LUCAS Soil) datasets were used to evaluate the potential of SI data from Vis-NIR and MIR in digital mapping of soil properties (i.e. soil organic carbon, clay, and pH) at a national scale. Cubist and quantile regression forests were used for spectral predictive modelling and DSM modelling, respectively. For both RMQS and LUCAS Soil dataset, different scenarios regarding varying proportions of SI data and laboratory observations were tested for spectral predictive models and DSM models. Repeated (50 times) external validation suggested that adding additional SI data can improve the performance of DSM models regardless of soil properties (gain of R2 proportion at 3–19%) when the laboratory observations are limited (≤50%). Lower proportion of SI data used in DSM model and higher accuracy of spectral predictive models led to greater improvement of DSM. Our results also showed that a greater proportion of SI data lowered the prediction intervals which may result in an underestimation of prediction uncertainty. The determination of accuracy threshold on SI data for the use in DSM needs to be explored in future studies.","2023-05-01","2024-01-19 10:23:38","2024-01-19 10:23:38","","116467","","","433","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital soil mapping; Measurement error; MIR spectroscopy; Proximal soil sensing; Vis-NIR spectroscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, how urban temperatures respond to urban form changes inside cities is still insufficiently understood. In this paper, we explored the relationship between urban form and diurnal space-time land surface temperature (LST) trends (2003–2019) in Beijing (continental climate), Cairo (arid) and Santiago (temperate). We analysed changes in land cover, white sky albedo (WSA), night-time lights (NL) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) inside areas representing clustered thermal performance (steady cold and hot spots and warming cold and hot spots). The structure of local climate zones (LCZs) was assessed for each LST trend. To test the relevance of other urban form dimensions, we analysed the hierarchical influence of the employed 2D metrics (i.e., built-up cover, WSA, NL and EVI) and additional 3D indicators (i.e., height and volume) on LST, applying machine learning classification and regression trees (CARTs) to Beijing's data. Despite diverse patterns of urban form change, cities in our sample present common LST trends, with thermal differences as a consequence of local climate. LCZs are composed of highly heterogeneous built-up areas inside LST trend categories. In the case of Beijing, LST is hierarchically driven by footprint, WSA and EVI. Moreover, by adding height and volume, urban form differences between LST trend classes that are not evident with 2D data were found. Our findings suggest that a compact green urban tissue is necessary to cope with the current trends of urban warming, taking into account city-specific measures based on the local background climate.","2022-07-15","2024-01-19 10:23:38","2024-01-19 10:23:38","","154570","","","830","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Spatial heterogeneity; Urban change; Urban composition; Urban warming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maintaining or restoring multifunctionality in agricultural landscapes is considered an efficient solution to achieve sustainable agricultural production because multiple ES provided by a landscape can support both environmental protection and socio-economic benefits. Quantifying the provision of ES provides fundamental information to measure landscape multifunctionality and inform sustainable land management strategies. Although a large number of studies have been carried out to measure landscape multifunctionality and associated ES, comprehensive spatially explicit assessments at the farm scale are limited. OBJECTIVE This research applies a wide range of spatial models, tools, and methods to spatially quantify the provision of multiple ES as well as the pattern of landscape multifunctionality in farmed landscapes. METHODS To quantify the provision of multiple ES provided by the landscape, the bio-physical models provided by InVEST (e.g., Nutrient Delivery Ratio and Sediment Delivery Ratio models) and land use land cover-based assessments using spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS were employed. The Analytic Hierarchy Process was applied to calculate the landscape multifunctionality index which is an integration of multiple ES supply. Hot spot analysis using Getis Ord Gi* statistics was utilised to examine the spatial distribution of multiple ecosystem services. A hill country farm in New Zealand is chosen as a case study because it is a good example of a diverse landscape that is facing significant environmental issues due to intensive agricultural production. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Our study reveals that the provision of ES and the pattern of landscape multifunctionality is highly variable across the farm. Both positive and negative relationships among ES are found and the interactions between them are mainly reflected in three ES bundles: the agricultural land, the indigenous forest and wetlands, and the mixed land uses. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that the quality of landscape is significantly dependent on the landscape management goals and preferences of the farmer so involving them into the process of ES and landscape multifunctionality assessment at a farm scale is essential step to obtain more comprehensive results. SIGNIFICANCE Results from this study enable important questions to be answered regarding the spatial variation of ES provision and how land use and land management goals relate to the value and quality of landscape multifunctionality. This can provide valuable information to design future multifunctional landscapes and inform decision making in relation to sustainable land use management.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:38","2024-01-19 10:23:38","","103494","","","203","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural intensification; Ecosystem services; Land use land cover; Landscape planning; Spatial analysis; Sustainable agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to technological constraints, it is difficult to provide simultaneously high spatial resolution, high temporal frequency, and high quality observation data. Existing mapping solutions are limited by traditional remotely sensed data, that have shorter observation periods, poor spatio-temporal consistency and comparability. Therefore, a new mapping paradigm is needed. This paper develops a framework for intelligent mapping (iMap) of land cover based on state-of-the-art technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual constellations, and spatio-temporal reconstruction and fusion. Under this framework, we built an automated, serverless, end-to-end data production chain and parallel mapping system based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and produced the first 30 m global daily seamless data cubes (SDC), and annual to seasonal land cover maps for 1985–2020. The SDC was produced through a multi-source spatio-temporal data reconstruction and fusion workflow based on Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR virtual constellations. Independent validation results show that the relative mean error of the SDC is less than 2.14%. As analysis ready data (ARD), it can lay a foundation for high-precision quantitative remote sensing information extraction. From this SDC, we produced 36-year long, 30 m resolution global land cover map data set by combining strategies of sample migration, machine learning, and spatio-temporal adjustment. The average overall accuracy of our annual land cover maps over multiple periods of time is 80% for level 1 classification and over 73% for level 2 classification (29 and 33 classes). Based on an objective validation sample consisting of FLUXNET sites, our map accuracy is 10% higher than that of existing global land cover datasets including Globeland30.

Mapping mangrove species and monitoring their conditions have been a crucial issue for achieving sustainable development goals. Currently combing multidimensional optical and SAR images with machine learning have become an important approach for mangrove species classification, but there are still some challenges in feature selection and hyperparameter optimizations. In this study, we proposed a novel classification framework by combing multi-scale variable selection algorithm (MUVR) with state-of-the-art machine learning hyperparameter optimization method (Optuna) for mapping mangrove species in the Beilun Estuary and Maowei Sea nature reserves using optical and dual-polarization SAR images, and further quantified the scattering characteristics of mangrove species using SAR image time series. We found that: (1) The MUVR algorithm could determine the optimal scale features for different scenarios and mangrove species, and improve the classification performance of machine learning with an overall accuracy (OA) improvement of 12.85%; (2) The Optuna-based optimal CatBoost outperforms LightGBM and NGBoost algorithms in mapping mangrove species, which achieved the highest OA (93.18%). This study demonstrated that LightGBM was suitable for identifying Aegiceras corniculatum, while the CatBoost algorithm was suitable for discriminating Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Cyperus malaccensis, Kandelia candel and Sonneratia apetala; (3) SAR images and its derivatives improved identification ability of mangrove species, and collaboration of multispectral images and SAR-derived features produced the better classification; (4) From 2018 to 2020, the backscattering coefficients of mangrove species in VV and VH polarization focused on 0.053–0.327 and 0.015–0.062, respectively.

In this study, we investigated plant diversity from 10-meter quadrats in 240 different rubber plantations in the six countries of the Great Mekong Subregion (GMS)—where nearly half of the world's rubber plantations are located—and analyzed the influence of original land cover types and stand age on plant diversity using Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery since the late 1980s. The results indicate that the average plant species richness of rubber plantations is 28.69 ± 7.35 (1061 species in total, of which 11.22 % are invasive), approximating half the species richness of tropical forests but roughly double that of the intensively managed croplands. Time-series satellite imagery analysis revealed that rubber plantations were primarily established in place of cropland (RPC, 37.72 %), old rubber plantations (RPORP, 27.63 %), and tropical forests (RPTF, 24.12 %). Plant species richness in RPTF (34.02 ± 7.62) was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that in RPORP (26.41 ± 7.02) and RPC (26.34 ± 5.37). More importantly, species richness can be maintained for the duration of the 30-year economic cycle, and the number of invasive species decreases as the stand ages. Given diverse land conversions and changes in stand age, the total loss of species richness due to rapid rubber expansion in the GMS was 7.29 %, which is far below the traditional estimates that only consider tropical forest conversion. In general, maintaining higher species richness at the earliest stages of cultivation has significant implications for biodiversity conservation in rubber plantations.","2023-05-20","2024-01-19 10:23:38","2024-01-19 10:23:38","","162505","","","874","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Greater Mekong Subregion; Original land cover types; Plant species richness; Rubber plantations; Stand age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India, has air pollution levels that exceed WHO standards. Its air has high PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO2 levels, exposing residents to an increased risk of respiratory diseases. AIRO, a decentralised IoT-based air quality monitoring solution, is proposed to calculate the (Air Quality Index) AQI in real-time and notify the users of dangerous AQI levels. Unlike the city's fixed air quality monitoring stations, this portable system can easily be integrated into everyday items for computing real-time air quality at any given place. The proposed solution is then validated using a physical prototype incorporated into a water bottle. Using the Intel Edison development platform, this prototype is equipped with a GPS module, Wi-Fi module, PMS5003, MQ131, MQ135, MQ136, MQ7 sensors, and an LCD Display. The prototype records the air quality indicators, calculates the AQI, and sends the data to the AWS Cloud Server. After an in-depth analysis of the cloud data, the daily and weekly AQI is predicted for multiple locations in the city. A hybrid CNN-Bi-LSTM model is proposed for predicting AQI, which needs to be evaluated at the city scale for dependable results. Finally, a smartphone app is developed using Android Studio and Python to monitor the air quality and notify the users. The users also have an option to select a location and get the real-time and predicted AQI.

Timely and comprehensive management of ASM is crucial to ensure that it can take place safely and cleanly, supporting sustainable development. The informal nature of the sector presents challenges related to documenting the locations of ASM. Remote sensing methods have been used to detect ASM, although difficulties with accuracy, resolution and persistent cloud cover have been encountered. This paper proposes a method of ASM detection using a deep convolutional neural network model applied to open source Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery. Firstly, the model is evaluated against both existing ASM detection methods and visual inspection of randomly sampled points. Secondly, the model is used to map mining and urban land use changes over a dataset spanning four years and 6 million hectares of southern Ghana, demonstrating the ability of this method to process very large areas. The omission and commission errors of less than 8% from the sampled points indicate that this model has achieved unprecedented levels of accuracy for the task of detecting ASM from satellite imagery. When applied to the case study area, the data on ASM trends over time demonstrate a correlation between the Ghanaian government's 2017 clampdown and ASM activities. The ASM land use category decreased by 6000 ha in 2017, despite a net increase of 15000 ha over the period 2015–2019. Additionally, the model was applied to quantify the extent of illegal mining related deforestation within Ghana's protected forests, measured at over 3500 ha, with 2400 of these lost since 2015. The results demonstrate that this methodology can detect ASM in Ghana with a high degree of accuracy at a minimal cost in terms of financial and human resources. The model shows strong generalisation abilities, offering exciting potential for using this methodology to further monitor and analyse ASM related land use changes worldwide.","2020-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:38","2024-01-19 10:23:38","","111970","","","248","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deep learning; Deforestation; Sentinel-2; Small-scale mining; Sustainable development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although wide range of computer vision methods have been used for modelling, effectively extracting spatiotemporal features from sky image sequence is still a tough task. In this study, a sparse spatiotemporal feature descriptor is introduced to enhance the process of dynamic spatiotemporal information extraction from continuous grayscale sky images, while spatial pyramid pooling is used for feature refinement. Parallelly, dense convolutional network is used to extract static features from the nearest single-frame RGB sky images. Both dynamic and static spatiotemporal features were adequately extracted and subsequently fused for the multi-step prediction of global horizontal irradiance. In addition, various competitive models in object detection are adopted as benchmarks for comparison. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method outperformed baseline models, with up to 5.51% reduction on normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and 9.38% improvement on ramp event forecast. The proposed method can be widely applied to photovoltaic stations equipped with all-sky-imagers.","2023-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:38","2024-01-19 10:23:38","","619-631","","","209","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ground-based sky image; Object detection; Solar irradiance forecasting; Spatial pyramid pooling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the lack of sufficient and representative training samples hinders automatic and accurate LC classification. In this study, we propose a new approach that integrates the automatic generation of training samples and machine learning algorithms (AGTML) for LC classification in Heilongjiang Province, China. After optimal focal radii were determined for different LC types using Landsat 8 based on focal statistics and unique phenology. Then target training samples were automatically generated based on the improved distance measure SED (a composite of Spectral angle distance (SAD) and Euclidean distance (ED)). Furthermore, LC classification was performed using four feature combinations and three machine learning algorithms. According to independent validation data, the automatically generated training samples demonstrated good representativeness and stability among all three classifiers, with an overall accuracy (OA) of classification higher than 86%, and showed high consistency in the landscape pattern of classification. RF yielded the highest classification accuracy (92.99% OA). AGTML outperformed GLC-FCS30 in identifying large fragmentation and small patch regions in the landscape types. The AGTML approach was subsequently applied to the Guanzhong Plain using different satellite imagery.

This study compiled a 16-year (2003–2018) dataset of river water quality (161,337 records from 2424 sites), watershed/landscape features, and meteorological conditions to investigate the spatial water quality patterns and underlying drivers of river impairment (defined as water quality worse than Class V according to China's Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Waters, GB3838-2002) at a national scale. Our analysis provided evidence of a distinct water quality improvement with a gradual decrease in the frequency of prevalence of anoxic conditions, an alleviation of the severity of heavy metal pollution, whereas the cultural eutrophication has only been moderately mitigated between 2003 and 2018. We also identified significant spatial variation with relatively poorer water quality in eastern China, where 17.2% of the sampling sites registered poor water quality conditions, compared with only 4.6% in western China. Total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) are collectively responsible for >85% of the identified incidences of impaired conditions. Bayesian modelling was used to delineate the most significant covariates of TP/NH3-N riverine levels in six large river basins (Liao, Hai, Yellow, Yangtze, Huai, and Pearl). Water quality impairments are predominantly shaped by anthropogenic drivers (82.5% for TP, 79.5% for NH3-N), whereas natural factors appear to play a secondary role (20.5% for TP, 17.5% for NH3-N). Two indicator variables of urbanization (urban areal extent and nighttime light intensity) and farmland areal extent were the strongest predictors of riverine TP/NH3-N levels and collectively accounted for most of the ambient nutrient variability. We concluded that there is still a long way to go in order to eradicate eutrophication and realize acceptable ecological conditions. The design of the remedial measures must be tailored to the site-specific landscape characteristics, meteorological conditions, and should also consider the increasing importance of non-point source pollution and internal nutrient loading.","2021-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","117309","","","201","","Water Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bayesian modelling; Eutrophication; River water quality; Urbanization; Watershed management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ideally, investigation of the energy response at the tree level may promote tailored irrigation strategies and, thus, maximize crop biomass productivity. However, data availability is limited and planning experimental campaigns in the field can be highly operationally complex. To this end, a multi-platform multi-sensor observational approach is herein developed to dissect the λET signature of a black poplar (Populus nigra) breeding population (“POP6”) at the canopy level. POP6 comprised more than 4600 trees representing 503 replicated genotypes, whose parents were derived from contrasting environmental conditions. Trees were trialed in two adjacent plots where different irrigation treatments (moderate drought [mDr] and well-watered [WW]) were applied. Data collected from satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remote sensing as well as from ground-based proximal sensors were integrated at consistent spatial aggregation and combined to compute the surface energy balance of the trees through a modified Priestley-Taylor method. Here, we demonstrated that λET response was significantly different between WW and mDr trees, whereby genotypes in mDr conditions exhibited larger standard deviations. Importantly, genotypes classified as drought tolerant based on the stress susceptibility index (SSI) presented λET values significantly higher than the rest of the population. This study confirmed that water limitation in mDr settings led to reduced soil moisture in the tree root zone and, thus, to lower λET. These results pave the way to breeding poplar and other bioenergy crops with this underexploited trait for higher λET. Most notably, the illustrated work demonstrates a multi-platform multi-sensor data fusion approach to tackle the global challenge of monitoring landscape-scale ecosystem processes at fine resolution.","2022-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","112771","","","268","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Multi-platform; multi-resolution; Priestley-Taylor equation; satellite remote sensing; UAV remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Establishing nature reserves aimed at counteracting the negative effects of anthropogenic activities is one of the most pivotal approaches to conserve mangrove ecosystems. Evaluation of the conservation effectiveness for mangrove nature reserves is thus indispensable for making knowledge-based conservation policies and funding-decisions by government and managers. In this study, using composited Landsat images by the Google Earth Engine cloud platform and object-oriented deep learning classification method, the land cover maps of national mangrove nature reserves (NMNRs) in China were obtained from 1987 to 2019. The systematic evaluation of conservation effectiveness for each NMNR was conducted by landscape metrics and an entropy weight model. Combined with the dynamics in mangrove distribution, human interference intensity, and natural environment change, the driving force factors affecting the conservation effectiveness for NMNRs were investigated. The results show that the total mangrove area in all NMNRs increased 968.6 ha during the study period, a 21.8 % rate of increase. Except for one NMNR with a slight decline, the conservation of remaining NMNRs was considered effective with increase varied from 14.8 % to 87.5 % in the level of protective efficacy. The conservation effectiveness of NMNRs was affected by both anthropogenic and natural factors, while the improvement to the conservation effectiveness was largely attributed to the implementation of protection policies, such as reforestation engineering. Further direct or indirect challenges in mangrove conservation effectiveness, e.g., pollution, natural disasters, and exotic species invasion, still require close attention. This study provides an effective and efficient approach to quantify the conservation effectiveness of mangrove nature reserves, which would facilitate mangrove conservation and management in the future.","2022-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","109265","","","142","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conservation effectiveness; Landscape development intensity index; National mangrove nature reserve; Object-oriented deep learning classification; Systematic assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study used 200 non-flood points and 200 historical flood points for developing the testing (30%) and training (70%) datasets. Multicollinearity diagnostic test (VIF) and information gain ratio (IGR) were used to measure the consistency of the selected twelve influencing factors. Rainfall, drainage density, clay content, distance from the river and elevation were the most important drivers of the selected influencing parameters. We found that the high and very high FSM areas of the basin were around 32.24% for random forest (RF), 47.46% for frequency ratio (FR), 46.41% for analytical hierarchic process (AHP), and 40.5% for SWPMA. Most of these areas lie in Alipurduar town surrounding areas and the lower part of the basin. The ROC (receiver operating characteristic), MAE (mean absolute error), RMSE (root mean square error), Kappa index and Pearson’s correlation coefficients were employed for the performance efficiency of four data-driven models. Achieved ROC values of the RF model, FR model, AHP model and SWPMA model were at 92.4%, 86.6%, 83.1% and 79.4% respectively.

Intertidal areas are exposed to particularly high levels of pressures owing to increased population density in coastal areas. Traditional methods of monitoring intertidal areas do not provide datasets with full coverage in a cost-effective or timely manner, and so the use of remote sensing to monitor these areas is becoming more common. Monitoring of ecologically important monospecific habitats, such as seagrass beds, using remote sensing techniques is well documented. However, the ability for multispectral data to distinguish efficiently and accurately between classes of vegetation with similar pigment composition, such as seagrass and green algae, has proved difficult, often requiring hyperspectral data. A machine learning approach was used to differentiate between soft-bottom intertidal vegetation classes when exposed at low tide, comparing 6 different multi- and hyperspectral remote and in situ sensors. For the library of 366 spectra, collected across Northern Europe, high accuracy (>80%) was found across all spectral resolutions. While a higher spectral resolution resulted in higher accuracy, there was no discernible increase in accuracy above 10 spectral bands (95%: Sentinel-2 MSI sensor with a spatial resolution of 20 m). This work highlights the ability of multispectral sensors to discriminate intertidal vegetation types, while also showing the most important wavelengths for this discrimination (∼530 and ∼ 730 nm), giving recommendations for spectral ranges of future satellite missions. The ability for multispectral sensors to aid in accurate and rapid intertidal vegetation classification at the taxonomic resolution of classes, could be a significant contribution for future sustainable and effective ecosystem management.","2023-05-15","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","113554","","","290","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Earth observation; Essential biodiversity variables; Intertidal mapping; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Satellite spectral data; Seagrass mapping; Spectral-radiometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The land use transition matrix was computed to describe characteristics of the transition, and a Bayesian hierarchical model was employed to investigate the spatial-temporal land use change patterns. Our results demonstrated that the arable land continuously decreased over the study period, while built-up land and vegetation gradually expanded. The primary land use transition occurred between the arable land and vegetation. The local trends of each county indicated obvious regional differences of land use change. Moreover, significant differences existed between deep poverty-stricken counties and normal poverty-stricken counties on arable land and built-up land change, indicating that more intense human construction activities in normal poverty-stricken areas.

Average yields increased in both winter wheat (2.38 %–4.96 %) and maize (5.41 %–6.85 %), with maize (RCP 4.5 > RCP 8.5 > RCP 2.6) more adapted to climate warming than winter wheat (RCP 2.6 > RCP 8.5 > RCP 4.5) in terms of yield increase rate. The yield increase and yield gap for winter wheat decreased most significantly in RCP2.6 (−2.28 %). Maize yield did not exceed 80 % of the potential yield in any scenario. The average phenological periods for winter wheat and maize are predicted be 2–4 and 9–16 days earlier, respectively. Crop yields were negatively correlated with radiation and yield gaps were positively correlated with precipitation. Future climate change will likely cause dramatic interannual crop yield fluctuations. Winter wheat is predicted to experience yield stagnation after 2050, whereas maize production potential will increase briefly before experiencing a long-term decline in growth. The results of this multi-scenario simulation assessment of crop production provide scientific support for implementing climate-adapted crop management strategies and integrated dry-crop-irrigated agriculture to meet food security objectives in this ecologically fragile area. We recommend integrated management measures to ensure regional food security through crop variety improvement, irrigation regulation, and planting structure optimization.","2023-12-10","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","166158","","","903","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Data assimilation; Food security; WOFOST","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most existing methods have trouble in generating quality fusion results when areas covered by the images undergoes rapid land cover changes or images have substantial registration errors. While deep learning algorithms have demonstrated their capabilities for imagery fusion, it is challenging to apply deep-learning-based fusion methods in regions that experiences persistent cloud covers and have limited cloud-free imagery observations. To address these challenges, we developed a Multi-scene Spatiotemporal Fusion Network (MUSTFN) algorithm based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our approach uses multi-level features to fuse images at different resolutions acquired by multiple sensors. Furthermore, MUSTFN uses the multi-scale features to overcome the effects of geometric registration errors between different images. Additionally, a multi-constrained loss function is proposed to improve the accuracy of imagery fusion over large areas and solve fusion and gap-filling problems simultaneously by utilizing cloud-contaminated images with the fine-tuning method. Compared with several commonly-used methods, our proposed MUSTFN performs better in fusing the 30-m Landsat-7 images and 500-m MODIS images over a small area that has undergone large changes (the average relative Mean Absolute Errors (rMAE) of the first four bands are 6.8% by MUSTFN as compared to 14.1% by the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), 12.8% by the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF), 8.4% by the Extended Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (ESRCNN), 8.1% by the Spatiotemporal Fusion Using a Generative Adversarial Network (STFGAN)). In particularly for images at different resolutions with different registration accuracies (e.g., 16-m Chinese GaoFen-1 and 500-m MODIS), MUSTFN achieved fusion results of good quality with an average rMAE of 9.3% in spectral reflectance at the first four bands. Finally, we demonstrated the applicability of MUSTFN (average rMAE of 9.18%) when fusing long-term Landsat-8 composite images and MODIS images over a large region (830 km × 600 km). Overall, our results suggest the effectiveness of MUSTFN to address the challenges in imagery fusion, including rapid land cover changes between image acquisition dates, geometric misregistration between images and limited availabilities of cloud-free images.

Coastal landscape of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has changed drastically. In order to explore the process and law of coastal landscape dynamics in GBA, in this research, multi-temporal Landsat images and proposed hybrid object-based image analysis and multi-level decision tree classification were applied to monitor the changing trends and current status of the coastal landscape in GBA from 1988 to 2018. There were 5818.58 km2 of natural wetlands in 2018, including mangroves (39.62 km2), tidal flats (73.64 km2), rivers (161.65 km2), and shallow seas (5543.67 km2). Due to the influence of anthropogenic activities, natural wetlands showed a decreasing trend, while artificial wetlands and non-wetlands have been increasing. Results indicated that the landscape in the study area showed a trend of fragmentation, the degree of landscape aggregation weakened, the dominant patches were scattered, the shape became more and more complex, and the landscape heterogeneity increased. Then, a future land use simulation model was used to simulate the coastal landscape change trends of GBA in 2028 under four scenarios. The mangrove has the fastest growth rate of 1.47 km2/a under wetland protection scenario. The tidal flat and paddy field would increase under scenarios of the wetland protection and farmland protection, respectively. The construction land has the fastest growth rate under the economic development scenario and would be 47.56 km2/a.

Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10 m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available. First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored. Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales. Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12% of the World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2's greatest strengths.","2018-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","598-614","","","216","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bathymetry; Coral reefs; Habitat mapping; Landsat; Sentinel-2; Sun glint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is crucial to assess the technical potential and economic environmental performance of PV for the HSR infrastructure. In this study, the PV potential of 973 stations of 108 HSR lines in China was studied in conjunction with geographic information system (GIS). The results showed that the PV capacity that can be deployed in China's HSR stations at horizontal and optimum tilt angles was 4.36 GW and 2.81 GW, with a total power generation capacity of 108.55 TWh and 74.88 TWh, respectively, which presented a huge power generation potential. The economic analysis showed that the All-consumption scenario and optimum tilt angle had better economic profits than the All-feed-into-grid scenario and the horizontal angle, respectively. Moreover, the use of PV could reduce carbon emissions by HSR stations by 79,895.73 kilotons and 55,112.53 kilotons at horizontal and optimum tilt angles, respectively.

Particular challenges exist in China where tidal flats are changing rapidly along with accelerated economic development in coastal regions. The unique and important ecosystem functions and services that tidal flats provide in coastal regions warrant the necessary of mapping such a particular land cover type in high precision and accuracy. Existing national tidal flat maps of China, which were derived from the 30-m resolution Landsat imagery and auxiliary data, are insufficient to support practical management efforts. In this study, in order to produce an accurate tidal flat map with finer spatial resolution, we employed 28,367 scenes of time series Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2019 and 2020 along the entire coastal line of China. The short revisit cycle (2–5 days) of the Sentinel-2 improved the opportunities of obtaining the highest and lowest tide images, and the finer spatial resolution (10-m) enhanced the capacity of precision tidal flat extraction. A rapid, robust, and automated tidal flat mapping approach is essential to large-scale applications. In this study, we developed an approach by integrating the maximum spectral index composite (MSIC) and the Otsu algorithm (OA), and so named MSIC-OA. By GEE platform, we automated the execution of MSIC-OA to Sentinel-2 images, and produced an up-to-date 10-m spatial resolution tidal flat map of China (China_Tidal Flat, CTF). Validated by massive field-based observations and selected edge-points, the CTF map achieved an overall accuracy of 95% and the F1 score of 0.93. As we calculated, the total area of tidal flats in China was 858,784 ha, and Jiangsu Province accounted the largest proportion (24%) of the national total. This study is the first attempt to delineate tidal flats automatically at a 10-m spatial resolution. The CTF map can provide essential information for management of coastal ecosystems and facilitate the implementations of coastal and marine related Sustainable Development Goals.","2021-03-15","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","112285","","","255","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","China; Edge-points reference; Google Earth Engine; Maximum spectral index composite (MSIC); Otsu algorithm (OA); Sentinel-2 imagery; Tidal flat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human intervention into the field of the destruction of nature is another cause of these forest fires. The ability to heal nature is dampened due to the expansion of human territories into forests causing loss of lands for the forests. While human expansion cannot be halted, so we as human must take a responsibility for the consequences and make sure the climatic changes due to such disasters, should be as low as possible. Halting the forest fires is an impossible task, and the best we can do control the fires and the amount of area burnt. This process can be improved by predicting the forest fires and the amount of area that might get burnt due to the predicted fire and take measures against it such that there would be no fire at all or the very least reduce the amount of area burnt during the fire. Machine learning in predictions of forest fires is heavily researched and mostly used in real-time. Though usage of machine learning algorithms has been in use, the accuracy of these models is of the lower levels.

However, the efficiency of NIRvP in estimating the GPP and its limitations across multiple biomes and climate zones remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance and limitations of NIRvP in estimating the GPP in comparison to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and the MOD17A2H GPP product. Overall, the correlation between NIRvP and eddy covariance (EC) GPP was stronger than that of APAR, SIF, and MOD17A2H GPP across most biomes with usually similar seasonal variations in radiation, air temperature (TA), and precipitation. The near-​infrared (NIR) reflectance (ρNIR) and light use efficiency (LUE) exhibited a covarying relationship under these environmental conditions, which suggested that the ρNIR contributed positively to the NIRvP-GPP relationship under such climatic conditions. However, the performance of NIRvP was poor in some biomes and climate zones, which exhibited different variations in the seasonal patterns of radiation, TA, and precipitation. The resulting inconsistencies between ρNIR and LUE implied that the ρNIR contributed negatively to the NIRvP-GPP relationship in these regions. Altogether, the findings demonstrated that the NIRvP-GPP relationship was robust but attained a moderate overall relationship across ecosystems (R2 < 0.50) in the majority of biomes and climate zones. In addition, this study also elucidated the limitations of NIRvP as a GPP proxy in certain climate zones, which was attributed to the synergistic contributions of APAR and ρNIR in the NIRvP-GPP relationship.","2023-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","103437","","","122","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomes; Climate zones; Gross primary production; Light use efficiency; Near-infrared radiation reflected by vegetation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use distance to waterbodies, including other covariates of meteorology and surface characteristics, such as the surface greenness and land cover type, to model near the surface concentration of PM2.5. Different machine learning (ML) approaches were applied to predict the spatio-temporal behavior of PM2.5. Out of different ML-based models, the random forest regression produces the highest predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.68), while, gradient boosting, support vector machine and artificial neural net have R2 less than 0.66. The outcome of the feature important score from random forest regression reveals that proximity to the water surface is more important than precipitation and land use and land cover (LULC). The results find that up to a distance of 3 km, the waterbody exerts a significant effect in lowering PM2.5 concentration.

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have gained a reputation amongst diverse science applications, including their popularity in monitoring land cover. Therefore, the present study investigates the performance of the ML-based classification algorithm random forest (RF) in monitoring LC classes for 2016 and 2021 for the metropolitan region of Kuwait City, Kuwait. The accuracy assessment for the derived land use maps achieved an overall accuracy of 93.6% and 95.3% and kappa coefficient values of 0.86 and 0.93 for 2016 and 2021, respectively. The results show an increase in built-up cover by ∼11 %. The land use maps for 2016 and 2021 were further used to predict the urban built-up for 2026 using an artificial neural network (ANN) based on multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNNs). It was predicted with an overall accuracy of 83.6%. The built-up was predicted to increase by 15% in 2021–2026, and mostly expansion was observed on the western and southern sides. The outcomes exhibit that MLPNN techniques combined with Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (RS and GIS) can be adopted to derive the land cover and predict the urban sprawl with fair accuracy and precision. Such studies would prove valuable to city governments and urban planners to improve future sustainable development strategies.","2023-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","381-392","","2","26","","The Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial neural network (ANN); Google earth engine (GEE); Land Use Land Cover (LULC); Multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNNs); Random forest; Sustainable development; Urban expansion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These factors have caused destruction of natural habitat and increased natural hazards such as flooding in the Municipality. Monitoring land use/land cover change is essential in respect to the dynamics of both human and natural factors that affect the biophysical and biochemical properties of the land surface. This research investigates the transitions among the major land use/land cover categories in the Municipality as a highly populated urban region that is facing some environmental challenges such as deforestation and degradation of the environment. Random Forest was adopted for the classification of 1985, 1991, 2002 and 2015 land cover maps while the analysis of the dynamics was conducted using intensity analysis. The unique contribution of this article is the combine usage of machine learning algorithm and intensity analysis to assess the changes in land use/land cover. The results showed that 1985–1991 and 2002–2015 periods experience fast change and the land use transformation has been accelerating over the whole period. The major changes were caused by the Built-up and Agricultural activities constituting 21.24 % and 13.19 % respectively in the category level. It is recommended that, authorities should consider several structural transformation measures within Ghana, including inter-sectoral land use harmonization policies (e.g. the Land Use and Spatial Planning Act 2016), land use planning and legal reforms to help address the underlying drivers of urban led deforestation.","2020-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","105057","","","99","","Land Use Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ghana; Intensity analysis; Random forest classification; UN sustainable development goals; Urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) data are acquired in a quad-polarization mode, and L-band POLSAR data in particular are one of the few SAR data types that preserve the dielectric properties and structures of the scatterer. POLSAR data consist of 2 × 2 scattering matrices and consequently offer superior target recognition compared with dual-polarization data. In this study, we applied scattering power decomposition suitable for detecting deforestation in near real-time to POLSAR data obtained from the Earth observation sensor Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2). The reflection symmetry condition is known to apply to natural distributed objects (i.e., the cross-correlation between co- and cross-polarization data is zero). Inspired by this, we theoretically and experimentally examined the volume scattering power component to distinguish natural forests from the surrounding area. Two important results were verified for natural forests: as the window size of the ensemble average increases, (i) the coherency matrix approaches a simple theoretical form and (ii) the volume scattering power becomes dominant among the scattering power components. Based on these results, we constructed an algorithm that applies scattering power decomposition for detecting deforestation. We produced reference data using high-resolution optical images and evaluated the performance of the derived deforestation map in the Amazon natural forest when employing various window sizes for the ensemble average. At an optimal window size of 15 × 15 pixels, the deforestation detection performance reached a user's accuracy of 94.9% ± 1.5%, a producer's accuracy of 72.3% ± 1.2%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.816 ± 0.0039. Sparse trees left after logging increased the volume scattering power and reduced the producer's accuracy. The proposed algorithm can contribute to deforestation detection with slightly lower accuracy than that of the annual map provided by Global Forest Change. Further, the proposed algorithm is robust to the seasonal variations in tropical rainforests and temporal variations in the deforestation process. Consequently, the proposed algorithm employing the six-component scattering power decomposition method can be utilized in near real-time without considering applicable areas in tropical rainforests. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to dual-polarization data, which are acquired by PALSAR-2 much more frequently than POLSAR data. The false detection rate did not increase when using the dual-polarization data; however, the omission error increased considerably compared with that when using POLSAR data owing to the low total power obtained from the dual-polarization data.","2022-06-15","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","113018","","","275","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deforestation; PALSAR-2; POLSAR; Reflection symmetry condition; Scattering power decomposition; Volume scattering power","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet billions of people globally lacking handwashing facilities with water and soap on premises, with gaps particularly found in low- and middle-income countries. Targeted efforts to expand access to basic hygiene services require data at geospatially explicit scales. Drawing on country-specific cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys with georeferenced hygiene data, we developed an ensemble machine learning model to predict the prevalence of basic hygiene facilities in Malawi, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan and Uganda. The ensemble model was based on a multiple-level stacking structure, where four predictive modelling algorithms were used to produce sub-models, and a random forest model was used to generalise the final predictions. An inverse distance weighted interpolation was incorporated in the random forest model to account for spatial autocorrelation. Local coverage and a local dissimilarity index were calculated to examine the geographic disparities in access. Our methodology produced robust outputs, as evidenced by performance evaluations (all R2 were above 0.8). Among the five study countries, Pakistan had the highest overall coverage, whilst Malawi had the poorest coverage. Apparent disparities in basic hygiene services measured by local coverage were found across geographic locations and between urban and rural settings. Nigeria had the highest level of inequalities in basic hygiene services measured by a dissimilarity index, whilst Malawi showed the least segregation between populations with and without basic hygiene services. Both educational attainment and wealth were important predictors of the geospatial distribution of basic hygiene services. By producing geospatially explicit estimates of the prevalence of handwashing facilities with water and soap, this study provides a means of identifying geographical disparities in basic hygiene services. The method and outputs can be useful tools to identify areas of low coverage and to support efficient and precise targeting of efforts to scale up access to handwashing facilities and shift social and cultural norms on handwashing.","2021-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:39","2024-01-19 10:23:39","","102549","","","135","","Applied Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Basic hygiene; Ensemble model; Handwashing; Machine learning; WASH; Water and soap","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this framework, the ESV equivalent, Markov Chain, System Dynamic, Future Land Use Simulation model were coupled, and the drivers reflecting planning policies were integrated. The framework was applied to the Pearl River Delta (PRD). We found that the ESV of PRD would decrease marginally in five scenarios, exhibiting an inverted U-shaped of increasing northward along the Pearl River Estuary, and there would be a noteworthy value-loss area at the junction of Foshan–Zhongshan. Under the scenarios of high-speed rail and innovation platform planning, the LULC patterns could better balance the relationship of economic development and ESV reduction. And the agglomeration effects of ESV would be strengthened simultaneously, which is more conducive for the ecological security pattern construction. Future development of the region could refer to the LULC patterns of these two scenarios, but attention must be paid to the low-values cluster in the southwest of Huizhou, northwest and east of Guangzhou.

In this context, the digital technologies described by Industry 4.0 appear as allies in the optimization of agribusiness. The use of these technologies is closely related to digital transformation, leading to this work's goal: to analyze the dimensions of Digital Transformation (DT) in the Modern Agricultural (MA) context. The methodology of this study was divided into three main parts. Firstly, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was performed with the help of the SciMAT® software. Then, a content analysis was performed using a semantic technique to define the dimensions a posteriori. Finally, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model using the RStudio® software was made to validate the results found in the semantic analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there are only five studies that define dimensions of DT in MA, however none of them used a robust SLR with content analysis. Two of these studies did empirical researches with specialists to define the dimensions, and the other three defined specifics dimensions only a priori. Our study brings as an innovation the definition of the dimensions a posteriori through the SLR. Additionally, no studies that validated the results using a LDA model were found. As a result of our studies, we have identified eight dimensions: Economical, Government, Sustainability; Infrastructure, Technological, Cooperation, Change, and People/Knowledge/Skills. The first three dimensions are more influenced by external factors, while external and internal factors influence the following three, and finally, the last two are more affected by internal factors. For each set of the dimensions listed, the main pillars/drivers/motivators and the main barriers/challenges/difficulties were identified. For example, for the mixed dimension, the first set can be the creation of regional centers that broadcast digital technology content. Regarding the second set, we can cite the difficulty in transforming data into useful information for the same dimension. The results serve as a foundation for both practical business actions and the academic field. They presented a robust theoretical basis for developing guidelines for agricultural management (of farms and other related startups and companies) and public policies to encourage the adoption and implementation of technological resources guided by sustainable development goals. The impacts can be viewed as: reduced production through sustainable and responsible production, assistance in the conscious and sustainable use of water resources, and sustainable actions to mitigate climate change. In conclusion, we highlight that the environment in which the framework will be applied should influence the emphasis given to each set of dimensions. For instance, legislators that seek to develop policies for DT in MA should pay greater attention to the external dimensions. In contrast, farmers that seek to implement DT should be more focused on the internal dimensions.","2022-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","613-637","","","34","","Sustainable Production and Consumption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Modern agriculture; Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrated the implementation of the method in two sites (Brady and Desert Peak geothermal sites) that are close to each other but have different characteristics (Brady having clear surface manifestations and Desert Peak being a blind site). We processed various satellite images and geospatial data for mineral markers, temperature, faults and deformation and then implemented ML methods to obtain pattern of surface manifestation of geothermal sites.

We tested the Geothermal AI using independent data sets obtaining accuracy of 92–95%; also tested the Geothermal AI trained on one site by executing it for the other site to predict the geothermal/non-geothermal delineation, the Geothermal AI performed quite well in prediction with 72–76% accuracy.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","134-149","","","192","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Automated labeling; Geophysics for exploration; Geothermal energy; Geothermal exploration; Machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flooding annually destroys properties, buildings, farmland, loss of life, etc. in various regions of the world. In this study, a new K-means clustering method that combined TDA and machine learning (ML) functions. The method is aimed at solving flood problems by identifying the feature patterns of floods associated with seven selected states in Nigeria; predicting flood menace; measuring the extent of spread of the resultant clusters (degree of flood risk) and choosing the best test that measures the validity of the analysis used. The study method is designed to provide vital information about shape characteristic of spatial data. Other advantages include its flexibility with other methods. It is threshold-free (i.e., no need to fix any threshold criteria for detection method; it has properties which does that). After our model's training process, we obtained the best group at k = 2, where we have the highest Silhouette coefficient that gave an efficiency outcome of approximately 80%. The method was able to detect the flooding and no flooding areas in the data, and the discovery of variability of clusters. The findings can provide information to dweller in flooding zones to vacate and avert flood disaster, and for the risk managers to take action. We recommend the method in flood mitigation and control.

As in many agroecosystems in the tropics, soil erosion is a major issue in poorly managed pasturelands. A noteworthy case is located in the Upper Taquari River Basin (UTRB), as part of the Upper Paraguay Basin on the plateau with drainage waters for the Taquari megafan in the Brazilian Pantanal. Here we combine slope (S-factor), erodibility (E-factor), rainfall-rainy day ratio (R-factor), and vegetation and soil indices (C-factor) to locate erosion risk and prioritize eco-engineering interventions via palisades and small dams in UTRB. The method consisted of assessing distinct weights between Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) factors in a GIS platform, providing 35 combinations of classes as low, moderate, high, and very high erosive risk. The validation of the method was based on the ravine and plain ground truths obtained from high-resolution raster data. The best weight of USLE factors aids to locate critical erosive sites and vegetation patterns. Then, erosion risk and interventions were analyzed according to land use and rural property sizes in the government's Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) database. Overall, the natural factors of slope and erodibility in a proportion of 25% and 75% in GIS algebra provided the best mapping accuracy result. About 65% of the UTRB has high or very high erosion risks, and 70% of the available area can be acknowledged as degraded pasturelands. A total of 4744 erosion interventions were recorded, with an accuracy of 65.28% and 61.15% for check dams and palisades interventions, respectively. The number of necessary interventions in areas of native vegetation was almost 50% higher than in pasturelands. Even though micro landowners occupy most of the watershed, large properties have about ten times as many areas at high risk of erosion. The mutual cooperation between properties, independently of size, is supported by governmental public policies like incentives for ecosystem services restoration of critical gullies, with CAR compliance and fiscalization.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","116219","","","323","","Journal of Environmental Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agrarian structure; Check dams; Gullies; Palisades; Soil erosion; USLE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Challenges remain in quickly quantifying the length, width, migration, and pattern changes of deltaic channels accurately and with a high frequency. Here, we develop a quantitative framework, which introduces a water occurrence algorithm based on Landsat time-series data and spatial morphological delineation methods, in order to measure DCN structures and associated changes. In examining the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Irrawaddy River Delta (IRD) as case studies, we analyze their conditions and trends between 1986 and 2018 at ten-year intervals. Both study areas have undergone various human interventions, including dam construction, sand mining, and land use change driven by urbanization. Our results show the following: (1) the use of a 0.5 water occurrence extraction based on Landsat time-series data, morphological delineation, and spatial change analysis methods can quantify the morphodynamics of DCNs effectively with a root-mean-square error of 15.1 m; (2) there was no evident channel migration in either PRD or IRD with average channel widths of 387.6 and 300.9 m, respectively. Most channels in the PRD underwent remarkable shrinkage, with average rates of 0.4–6.4 m/year, while there were only slight changes in the IRD, which is consistent with observed trends in sediment load variation. The results of this research have the potential to contribute to sustainable river management in terms of flood prevention, riparian tideland reclamation, and water and sediment regulation. Moreover, the proposed framework can be used to develop a new global delta channel network dataset and can be generalized to remotely sensed water discharge and river depth estimation.","2021-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","126688","","","600","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Channel migration; Channel width; Delta channel network; Landsat time-series; Remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The position, aspect and slope are the ey geometrical parameters being optimised for each photovoltaic array. The predicted energy generation (i.e. photovoltaic potential) is simulated by using state-of-the-art hourly shadowing estimation from the surroundings, anisotropic diffuse, reflected, and direct irradiances that are based on a Typical Meteorological Year, and non-linear efficiency characteristics of a considered photovoltaic system configuration. The optimisation performs multiple simulation scenarios throughout an entire year for each photovoltaic array, in order to maximise its photovoltaic potential.

Therefore, a spatiotemporally continuous CO2 concentration dataset with high-spatiotemporal resolution was generated based on satellite CO2 observations and environmental factors in this study. First, the environmental factors affecting atmospheric CO2 concentrations were selected, and by integrating the atmospheric CO2 concentration data observed by the OCO-2 satellite, a sample dataset was created. The extreme random tree (ERT) model was then trained to determine the relationship between environmental factors and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Finally, spatiotemporally continuous atmospheric CO2 concentration data (0.01° and 8-day resolution) over the global continent were generated based on the established ERT model and environmental data. Validation results based on ground atmospheric CO2 concentration observations indicated that the estimated atmospheric CO2 concentration achieved satisfactory performance with coefficients of determination and root mean square errors of 0.83 and 1.79 ppm, respectively.

The establishment of such SFIm requires basic soil properties that can be modelled for spatial mapping. The objective of this study was to take advantage of Benin soil legacy data to produce a digital SFIm at a national level based on 8 soil properties (soil organic matter, nitrogen, pH (water), exchangeable potassium, assimilable phosphorus, sum of bases, cation exchange capacity and base saturation). Specific research aims were (1) to model and develop digital soil maps, (2) to identify the key covariates influencing soil nutrients, and (3) to build an SFIm using digital maps of the soil properties. For each soil property, modelling procedures involved the use of different covariates, including soil type, topographic, bioclimatic and spectral data, along with the comparative assessment of the cubist (CB) and quantile random forest (QRF) models. Models were evaluated not only on the basis of classical error metrics (RMSE, R2) but also on the ability to predict local uncertainty based on the prediction interval coverage probability (PICP). The results revealed that CB performed marginally better than the QRF based on classical error metrics (R2, RMSE) but produced the worst uncertainty with an overestimation of the local uncertainty. This suggested that the use of accuracy plots such as PICP to evaluate models can identify accuracy problems not evident with classical error metrics. The analysis revealed that the distance to the nearest stream, which was part of topographic covariates, had strong predictive ability for all the soil properties along with the bioclimatic variables. The spatial distribution of the different classes of SFIm showed a preponderance of low fertility levels with severe limitations for crop development. A limited number of high and average fertility level soils were found in the low elevation areas of southern Benin, and policy could advocate for their sole use for agricultural purposes and promote sustainable management practices.","2022-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","e00444","","","28","","Geoderma Regional","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital soil mapping; Multiple soil classes; Random forest; Soil fertility index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In line with these trends and the increasing recognition of the significance of cities in addressing local and global challenges, a lot of research has been published on urban studies and planning since the middle of the twentieth century. While the number of publications has been rapidly increasing over the past decades, there is still a lack of studies analyzing the field's knowledge structure and its evolution. To fill this gap, this study analyzes data related to more than 100,000 articles indexed under the “Urban Studies” and “Regional & Urban Planning” subject categories of the Web of Science. We conduct various analyses such as term co-occurrence, co-citation, bibliographic coupling, and citation analysis to identify the key defining thematic areas of the field and examine how they have evolved. We also identify key authors, journals, references, and organizations that have contributed more to the field's development. The analysis is conducted over five periods: 1956–1975 (the genesis period), 1976–1995 (economic growth and environmentalism), 1996–2015 (sustainable development and technological innovation), 2016–2019 (climate change and SDGs), and 2020 onwards (post-COVID urbanism). Four major thematic areas are identified: 1) socio-economic issues and inequalities, 2) economic growth and innovation, 3) urban ecology and land use planning, and 4) urban policy and governance and sustainability. The first two are recurring themes over different periods, while the latter two have gained currency over the past 2–3 decades following global events and policy frameworks related to global challenges like sustainability and climate change. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, issues related to smart cities, big data analytics, urban resilience, and governance have received particular attention. We found disproportionate contributions to the field from the Global North. Some countries from the Global South with rapid urbanization rates are underrepresented, which may have implications for the future of urbanization. We conclude the study by highlighting thematic gaps and other critical issues that need to be addressed by urban scholars to accelerate the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities.","2023-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","100740","","","173","","Progress in Planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Smart cities; Urban Planning; Urban resilience; Urban Studies; Urban sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contradictions and conflicts regarding different uses of land are becoming increasingly problematic. The question of how to coordinate the competition among the driving factors of land resources and how to balance and optimize land use types with different functions are urgent problems related to achieving sustainable development. In this study, the traditional model of the land use change process and a machine learning algorithm were integrated to establish an optimal land use allocation model considering macro-quantity control and spatial unit allocation. Taking Ningbo as an example, on the basis of considering the function of land resources and the driving mechanism of land use change, genetic algorithm (GA) and patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model were used to optimize the quantitative structure and spatial layout of production−living−ecological land (PLEL), respectively. The GA-PLUS model demonstrated strong robustness. The results show that Ningbo covers a total land area of 9816 km2, and the rates of increase in the area of production land (PL), living land (LL) and ecological land (EL) in Ningbo from 2010 to 2018 were −2.04%, 10.07% and −0.69%, respectively. The main problems were the unbalanced distribution of PLEL, the disordered expansion of industrial production land (IPL) and LL, occupying 3.07% of agricultural production land and 0.67% of EL. Guided by Sustainable Development Goals, the construction goals related to the Beautiful China policy and the development planning goals of Ningbo city, the collaborative optimization of the quantitative structure and spatial layout of PLEL in Ningbo can be realized through the GA-PLUS model. In terms of quantitative structure, Ningbo needs to control the total amount of construction land in the future, and improve the proportion of LL and EL, about 13.04% and 51.75%. In terms of spatial layout, it is necessary to build industrial clusters for IPL in coastal areas, improve the suitability of EL in the north of Ningbo, and address the fact that it is difficult for LL to expand due to the influence of the complex terrain in Yuyao and Xiangshan. The results of this study can guide the optimization and development path of the territorial space of Ningbo, and provide technical support for decision-makers to formulate targeted land space planning and realize regional sustainable development.","2022-11-15","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","134004","","","375","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Function identification; GA-PLUS model; Overall optimization; Production–living–ecological land; SDGs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Application of the existing infrastructures of railway stations and available land along rail lines for photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation has the potential to power high-speed bullet trains with renewable energy and supply surplus electricity to surrounding users. In this work, a methodology based on a geographic information system was established to evaluate the PV potential along rail lines and on the roofs of train stations. The Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway (HSR) was used as a case study. Its total PV potential reached 5.65 GW (of which the station potential accounted for 264 MW, approximately 4.68%, of the total potential), with a lifelong generation capacity of 155 TWh, which corresponds to approximately 12% of the total new installed capacity of China in 2020. Although electricity prices and solar resources differed along the railway line, all PV systems were profitable. Moreover, a comparison between the electricity consumption and generation shows that the PV+HSR system can cover most of the electricity demand of the Beijing-Shanghai HSR without a storage system. This concept can be further expanded to other rail lines and stations. Within the context of global carbon peaks and carbon neutrality, the integration of PV and railway systems should be promoted.","2022-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","106091","","","178","","Resources, Conservation and Recycling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Infrastructure; Photovoltaic; Railway system; Techno-economic analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With freely available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, we mapped for the first time polyethylene silage bags used for forage conservation in a year with the Random Forest algorithm, and proposed them as a spatial indicator of cattle intensity. For this, we combined monthly silage area with land cover and climatic variables in a regression framework to understand cattle intensity metrics at regional and farm scales throughout 20 million hectares in the Dry Chaco. In addition, we explored the impact of using maize silage supplementation on productive and environmental metrics at the farm scale in a precipitation gradient. We validated our models using a spatially explicit database of cattle distribution. Our results highlight that silage bags are accurate mappable objects with Sentinel-2, which can contribute to the understanding of cattle density, and heifer and steer density in pasture contexts at farm and regional scales. Finally, our whole-farm simulations support the idea that incorporating silage supplementation in cattle ranching regional analyses conducts to significant differences on environmental or productive estimations, which should be considered. The amount of stored forage that is used in supplementation has strong implications for the performance of cattle ranching, but remains difficult to quantify at the regional level with remote sensing. Silage bag mapping is thus an opportunity to improve the overall understanding of livestock intensification and its productive and environmental impacts, particularly in highly seasonal rangelands. Following this metric could be a valuable indicator of the cattle ranching performance in terms of it resilience, production increase and impacts over natural ecosystems (related to Sustainable Development Goal 2-zero hunger and also in the 15-life on land).","2023-01-10","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","158390","","","855","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural plastic; Cattle ranching intensification; Machine learning object detection; On farm-storage; Strategic supplementation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also proposed a new hyperspectral soil salinity index using Shannon entropy-based aggregation of selected absorption features. The newly proposed index outperformed other majorly used remote sensing-based salinity indices. It also showed a strong correlation with measured EC (r = 0.68) and ML-predicted soil EC (r = 0.78), both being significant at 1% level of significance. The index was effective in classifying HRS images into six distinct salinity classes. We also assessed the feasibility of applying the proposed salinity index for future hyperspectral missions through the simulation of various spectral-spatial resampling scenarios and estimated the optimal spectral and spatial resolution for salinity prediction. The hyperspectral salinity index can be directly estimated from HRS data without the need for time-consuming and expensive field samplings and used as a proxy to evaluate soil salinity status under field conditions.","2023-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","191-212","","","200","","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ensemble machine learning; Hyperspectral remote sensing; interpretable Machine learning; Soil salinity index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) model, we assessed the spatial and temporal dynamics of wind erosion on the Mongolian Plateau from 1982 to 2018. Our results showed that the wind erosion intensity on the Mongolian Plateau increased from northeast to southwest. The annual mean wind erosion modulus was 46.5 t·ha−1 in 1982–2008, with a significant decline at a rate of −5.1 t·ha−1·10 yr−1. The intensity of wind erosion was the strongest in spring, followed by autumn and summer, and was weakest in winter. During 1982–2018, wind erosion showed a significant decreasing trend in all seasons except winter. The wind erosion contribution of spring to the total annual wind erosion significantly increased, while that of summer significantly decreased.

Digital soil mapping (DSM) can provide the tools to fill this gap, but the uptake in developing countries have been slow. Local research is required to adapt internationally developed methodologies to unique local situations. In southern Africa DSM research have reached the level where DSM tools can now be used in commercial soil related projects. Several DSM case studies, conducted across Southern Africa, have provided the platform from which this work is presented. These case studies were done for a range of situations, including environmental settings with variations, size, data availability and aim of the soil map. Three different approaches have been identified as useful DSM tools, with varying costs and level of information it provides. Land type disaggregation is the cheapest, as it is largely desktop based, but can only produce small scale soil association maps. The expert knowledge approach is the most widely used commercially. Large scale soil associations can be mapped, and 30 soil observations per homogeneous soil distribution area are required. Machine learning methods can map soil properties, but rely on large data sources, consequently it is the costliest. Machine learning is therefore used to produce large scale maps large areas, where cost can be diluted. This paper gives an outline of DSM research in southern Africa and presents a case study of each of the DSM approaches, showing the methodology, potential and limitations of the approach within a commercial context. Specific case studies presented in this paper include the agricultural assessment of 166 km of pipeline for a water distribution project in Limpopo (land type disaggregation), a land capability assessment of a 15,000 ha open coal mining area in Mozambique (expert knowledge) and hydropedological mapping in Johannesburg (machine learning).","2019-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","1301-1308","","","337","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Commercial use; Cost effective; Environmental Impact Assessments; Expert knowledge; Land type disaggregation; Machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cities in developing countries, in particular, face serious problems involving infrastructure, traffic congestion, and services accessibility. These factors, made worse by poor planning, lead to social inequality. This paper conducts a multidimensional analysis of how travel times and the related opportunity costs lead to transport-related social exclusion (TRSE) situations in Ajegunle, in Lagos, Nigeria. Our contribution to the literature is to extend and quantify the TRSE framework in the case of a low-income community in a developing country. The methodology applies an interdisciplinary research design that uses open-access remote-sensing and route planning web applications (Google Maps, Google Earth, and Lara.ng) and a critical literature review, embedded in a TRSE framework. Thereby we obtain the difference between the estimated and the ideal travel times that residents of this community take to reach locations offering five different services – education, work, shopping, leisure, and health – distributed in seven locations across the city. Based on the difference between the estimated and ideal travel times, which on average is between half an hour and two hours, we calculate the opportunity cost based on local living wages as benchmark, which results in an average between 7.6% and 27.4% of the daily wages. This concept captures a temporal and spatial valuation, expressed in monetary terms, of the impact of an inadequate public transport system on poorer residents' everyday lives. This analysis using the TRSE framework shows that poor public transport, and consequently high opportunity costs, translates into social exclusion in this low-income community. Finally, we recommend a set of practical transport, urban-planning, and social policies that can remedy this predicament.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","103388","","","102","","Journal of Transport Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lagos; Opportunity cost; Public transport; Social exclusion; Traffic; Transport poverty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we propose to tackle a novel transit mobility structure detection problem, which hinges on high-level mobility patterns that characterize collective movement dynamics across the study region. To this end, we propose a machine learning-based approach to discover meaningful urban mobility structure using big transit data. We contend that both transit mobility patterns and local urban function information should be considered during the detection of transit mobility structure. By integrating different sources of urban data, we model the network of transit mobility as an attributed graph: local static urban functions are described by attributed features for graph nodes whereas travel dynamics are captured via a transit mobility pattern matrix. Similarities of both attributed features and transit mobility patterns are jointly embedded to derive compact low-dimensional vector representations via graph auto-encoder. Mobility structure is then extracted using unsupervised clustering and gap statistics. The proposed approach is capable of synthesizing both mobility and static information in a data-driven manner, preserving original urban topological structure and resident movement dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has the applicability of unveiling meaningful transit mobility structure in large metropolitan areas. The detected mobility community maps present a holistic overview of public transit movement structure, enabling decision makers to make informed decisions on sustainable urban development and transit management.","2021-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","103027","","","72","","Sustainable Cities and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Auto-encoder; Clustering; Graph embedding; Public transit; Smart card data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Landslide spatial distribution was determined using land use activities for the year 2021. The land use map was generated using supervised classification by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. In addition, the accuracy assessment was applied using Kappa coefficient to validate the land use classification. A total of 70 historical landslide points was used to analyse the spatial relationship between landslide and land use activities. Based on the results, land use category at Langat River Basin was dominated by agriculture with 59.65%. The overall accuracy for land use classification was 90.81% and kappa coefficient was 0.88. Meanwhile, the spatial relationship between landslide occurrence and land use activities was higher in the built-up area with 48.57%. The growing population and economic sector in Langat River Basin were found to be contributing to the increase in built-up areas. Thus, these results are particularly useful in understanding the spatial relationship between landslide occurrence and land use activities where the development area is more vulnerable to facing landslide disasters.

Air pollution can result from natural causes, including volcanic eruptions and extreme droughts, or human activities, including motor vehicle emissions, industry, and the burning of farmland and forests. Emission sources emit multiple pollutant types with diverse characteristics and impacts. However, there has been little research on the risk of multiple air pollutants; thus, it is difficult to identify multi-pollutant mitigation processes, particularly in Southeast Asia, where air pollution moves dynamically across national borders. In this study, the main objective was to develop a multi-air pollution risk index product for CO, NO2, and SO2 based on Sentinel-5P remote sensing data from 2019 to 2020. The risk index was developed by integrating hazard, vulnerability, and exposure analyses. Hazard analysis considers air pollution data from remote sensing, vulnerability analysis considers the air pollution sources, and exposure analysis considers the population density. The novelty of this study lies in its development of a multi-risk model that considers the weights obtained from the relationship between the hazard and vulnerability parameters. The highest air pollution risk index values were observed in urban areas, with a high exposure index that originates from pollution caused by human activity. Multi-risk analysis of the three air pollutants revealed that Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines had the largest percentages of high-risk areas, while Indonesia had the largest total high-risk area (4361 km2). Using the findings of this study, the patterns and characteristics of the risk distribution of multiple air pollutants in Southeast Asia can be identified, which can be used to mitigate multi-pollutant sources, particularly with respect to supporting the clean air targets in the Sustainable Development Goals.","2023-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:40","2024-01-19 10:23:40","","158825","","","854","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Air quality; Multi-source air pollution; Risk hazard model; Sentinel 5P; Southeast Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two benchmarking models use datasets containing building characteristics and annual energy use from ten major cities. To examine the difference in performance between linear and non-linear models, we use random forest and lasso regression. Results demonstrate that benchmarking models using open data outperform models based solely on the CBECS dataset. Additionally, our results indicate that building area, property type, conditioned area, and water usage are the most important variables for cities to collect.

As the United Nations (UN) projects 5.1 billion population will live in urban areas in 2030, it is crucial to measure, compare, and understand land consumption for our cities across the globe. Currently global approaches for land consumption analysis rely on settlement layers produced by remote sensing data and population data achieved by distributing census data over settlement layers. These layers, however, do not have sufficient spatial details to capture the intra-urban structural variability within a city. In this study, we develop a classification system that consistently produces accurate local climate zone (LCZ) maps at intra-urban scale for 40 cities using Sentinel data. We use the LCZ classes as proxies to disaggregate the global population grids (GHS-POP) to this intra-urban scale. With the refined data, we perform an intra-urban land consumption analysis for 40 cities across the globe. Our measurements shows that current per-city land consumption studies severely deviate from the intra-urban variability. We argue urban land consumption at global scale must proceed to an intra-urban resolution.

The optimization of farm resources, as well as the control of soil degradation processes (e.g., soil erosion), can be realized through crop monitoring in the field, aiming to manage the local spatial variability (time and space) with a high resolution. In the case of high profitability crops, as the case of vineyards for high-quality wines, the capability to manage and follow spatial behavior of plants during the season represents an opportunity to improve farmer incomes and preserve the environmental health. However, any field monitoring represents an additional cost for the farmer, which slows down the objective of a diffuse sustainable agriculture. Satellite multispectral images have been widely used for production management in large areas. However, their observation is limited by the pre-defined and fixed scale with relatively coarse spatial resolution, resulting in limitations in their application. In this paper, encouraged by recent achievements in convolutional neural network (CNN), a multiscale full-connected CNN is constructed for the pan-sharpening of Sentinel-2A images by UAV images. The reconstructed data are validated by independent multispectral UAV images and in-situ spectral measurements. The reconstructed Sentinel-2A images provide a temporal evaluation of plant responses using selected vegetation indices. The proposed methodology has been tested on plant measurements taken either in-vivo and through the retrospective reconstruction of the eco-physiological vine behavior, by the evaluation of water conductivity and water use efficiency indexes from anatomical and isotopic traits recorded in vine trunk wood. In this study, the use of such a methodology able to combine the pro and cons of space-borne and UAVs data to evaluate plant responses, with high spatial and temporal resolution, has been applied in a vineyard of southern Italy by analyzing the period from 2015 to 2018.

Land use and land cover change maps were generated from 1991 to 2021 at intervals of five years. On the basis of the weighted arithmetic water quality index approach, the water quality for the same years was likewise divided into five classes. The relationship between land use/land cover dynamics and water quality was then evaluated using correlations, multiple linear regressions, and principal component analysis. According to the computed water quality index, the water quality decreased from 65.34 in 1991 to 246.76 in 2021. The built-up area showed an increase of over 338%, whereas the amount of water decreased by over 61%. While barren land exhibited a negative correlation with nitrates, ammonia loadings, total alkalinity, and total hardness of the water, agriculture and built-up areas positively correlated with water quality parameters such as nutrient loading, turbidity, total alkalinity, and total hardness. A principal component analysis revealed that built up areas and changes in vegetated areas have the biggest impact on water quality. These findings suggest that land use and land cover modifications are involved in the deterioration of water quality around the city.

However, many landscape and hydrological connectivity metrics are highly correlated and may introduce redundancies and misleading results when use conventional multivariate regression techniques. Knowledge concerning the pure effects of landscape and hydrological connectivity metrics are crucial for understanding nonpoint pollution processes and guiding water quality protection strategies in reservoirs. Based on water quality monitoring data for six years (2015–2020) from 66 reservoir bays of the Danjiangkou Reservoir in China during both flood discharge periods (FDPs) and water storage periods (WSPs), machine learning approaches (boosted regression trees and random forest) were conducted to decipher the effects of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on water quality. The results showed that landscape composition, landscape configuration, and topography had the combined importance of 46.69%, 31.48%, and 10.14% on the overall water quality changes during the FDPs, respectively. However, landscape configuration was the largest importance factor controlling overall water quality for the WSPs with the combined importance of 38.57%. For the FDPs, the top two importance variables of overall water quality variation were the proportions of shrub and agricultural land in the reservoir bay. For the WSPs, the top two importance variables were flow length and index of connectivity. For specific water quality parameters, the highest importance factor controlling the variation in total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate and chlorophyll a were landscape configuration, while the landscape composition had the highest importance on the variation in permanganate index, suggesting landscape characteristics affected water quality with specific responses to distinct water quality parameters. These findings emphasize the distinct roles of landscape and hydrological characteristics on water quality and provide important information for the efficient formulation of water quality protection strategies in reservoirs.","2022-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","128410","","","613","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrological connectivity; Landscape characteristics; Machine learning; Reservoir bay; Water quality index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, using Kenya as the study area, we sought to identify the key drivers that affect greening and browning trends within the 4 main land cover types (agriculture, forest, grassland and shrubland) and within an area characterised by land cover change. The methodological approach used was the random forest classification algorithm, whereby the dependent variable was represented as 4 classes of NDVI greening and browning trends (strong browning, moderate browning, moderate greening, and strong greening). The explanatory variables (n = 28) were broadly grouped into 2 categories, natural and anthropogenic, and included a number of variables as proxies for broad socio-economic development. All models showed strong performance, and the mean values for accuracy and Kappa were 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. Variables that repeatedly featured as the 5 most important variables across the datasets were: travel time to an urban area, distance to towns, distance to roads, distance to rivers, slope and vulnerability to climate change impacts. When the variables were grouped by SDGs, the results obtained showed that the variables grouped under the SDGs 15 (life on land), 8 (economic growth) and 13 (climate action) cumulatively accounted for approximately 80% of the prediction of the greening and browning trends. Our results raise the following considerations to enrich on-going and future policy and planning discussions aimed at addressing LDN: the implementation of LDN should be anchored on tried and tested SLM interventions; further analysis of the drivers of greening and browning trends should be undertaken at the sub-national level; integrated approaches that lead to greater alignment across multiple development priorities, including climate change, should be promoted; and targeted enforcement of environmental legislation is needed to deter processes and activities that are likely to lead to the degradation of land.","2019-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","100251","","","15","","Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Drivers; Kenya; Land degradation-neutrality; NDVI; Random forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the impact of natural and land use factors on PM2.5 concentration has previously been quantified, in this paper we show that multiple environmental factors exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity at a range of scales. A more comprehensive analysis of PM2.5 variations require the potential effects of seasonal variations in meteorological conditions, interactions between natural and land use factors, and possible multi-scale spatial effects to be accounted for. Based on the global remote sensing inversion dataset, the aim of this study is to elucidate the spatially heterogeneous relationships of PM2.5 concentrations with natural and land use factors, and their multi–scale effects. This is achieved through combining geographical detector (GD), random forest (RF) and multiscale geographically weighted regression modelling (MGWR) to reveal the underlying mechanisms of spatial variation of PM2.5 concentrations in the Niger River Watershed (NRW). The results show that natural factors, represented by meteorological and topography variables, are most prominent. Human activities, represented by land use, have significant indirect effects through interactions with meteorological factors. Elevation (ELE) and annual minimum temperature (TMIN) emerge as the most important interaction centers among natural factors. In addition, the interaction between natural and land use factors are crucial in considering PM2.5 transmission and dispersion in the NRW. The topography and meteorological factors underlie the basic spatial pattern PM2.5 concentrations in the NRW, among which seasonal meteorological parameters have a more prominent impact on PM2.5 concentration. Both natural and land use factors exhibit strong non–stationarity in respect of spatial variations in PM2.5, and the effect of environmental factors in general on PM2.5 is scale–dependent. Transport and dispersion are important constraints in terms of aerosol loading regionally. The study suggests that coupling processes between meteorological conditions, land use and PM2.5 concentrations, based on the scale effects of each factor, should be accounted for in developing aerosol pollution regulations and cooperative management strategies in the region.","2023-03-25","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","136406","","","394","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Land use; MGWR model; Niger River watershed; PM concentrations; Random forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there remains a lack of global high-precision product of impervious surface area, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions, due to the difficulty of human settlement extraction from remote sensing data. The complexity and variability of human settlements makes it difficult to identify and delineate impervious surfaces by using a single data source or classifier. In this paper, we employed Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical images, in conjunction with a range of ancillary datasets that were publicly available (such as nighttime light data and ecological zone information), to develop an accurate extraction and updating approach for global impervious surface area mapping across various geographical regions. We generated two high-resolution global impervious surface area (Hi-GISA) maps for 2015 and 2018 with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The resultant Hi-GISA maps not only provided a detailed distribution of human settlements in both urban and rural areas, but also helped quantitative change analysis in terms of both expansion and reduction. Conventionally, we randomly selected 3,980 and 4,354 blocks with a size of 300 m × 300 m for the respective datasets in 2015 and 2018, to compare the accuracy of our product with other products. The validation results show that the Hi-GISA data in in each year reached a R2 higher than 0.8 and achieved a mean overall accuracy over 88%. The areal estimations demonstrated that global impervious surfaces rose from 1.27 million km2 in 2015 to 1.29 million km2 in 2018 with an increase of 20,000 km2. Nearly 80% of global impervious surfaces was contributed by 20 nations led by China, USA, and Russia. At the same time, South America had experienced the most significant growth (∼3.35%) among all continents, followed by Africa (∼2.59%). The Hi-GISA datasets provide new baseline products of global impervious surface area at 10 m resolution. These maps combined with other socioeconomic data could contribute to monitoring and analysis of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular, SDG 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3, and would also be valuable in assessing other SDG targets related to “Sustainable cities and communities”.

For the purpose of assigning ratings to the parameters, ten experts' opinions were taken into account. The final soil fertility map indicates that 18.01% of the land is in excellent health condition to support Tulaipanji cultivation. The artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and Bagging models-based suitability analysis was also done using geo-spatial and soil data for Tulaipanji cultivation. Nevertheless, the ANN is the more appropriate model for locational analysis of Tulaipanji cultivation. The ANN-based findings show that areas of 25.8% (77.89 sq. km) are excellent for growing Tulaipanji rice, about 22.01% (66.45 sq. km) are highly suitable, 19.84% (59.90 sq. km) are moderately suitable, 21.19% (63.97 sq. km) are low suitable and 11.16% (33.69 sq. km) are not suitable for Tulaipanji rice cultivation.

In this paper we use a manually annotated dataset consisting of approximately 10,000 photos acquired at street level in the urban area of Medellín to explore the potential for using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically detect building materials and types of lateral-load resisting systems, which are attributes that define a building's structural typology (which is a key issue in exposure models for seismic risk assessment). The results of the developed model achieved a precision of 93% and a recall of 95% when identifying nonductile buildings, which are the buildings most likely to be damaged in an earthquake. Identifying fine-grained material typology is more difficult, because many visual clues are physically hidden, but our model matches expert level performances, achieving a recall of 85% and accuracy scores ranging from 60% to 82% on the three most common building typologies, which account for 91% of the total building population in Medellín.

Winter rapeseed is an important oil crop in China that is mainly distributed in the Yangtze River Valley. Traditional winter rapeseed mapping practices are insufficient since they only use the spectral characteristics during the critical phenological period of winter rapeseed, which are usually limited to a small region and cannot meet the needs of large-scale applications. In this study, a novel phenology-based winter rapeseed index (PWRI) was proposed to map winter rapeseed in the Yangtze River Valley. PWRI expands the date window for distinguishing winter rapeseed and winter wheat, and it has good separability throughout the flowering period of winter rapeseed. PWRI also improves the separability of winter rapeseed and winter wheat, which traditionally have been two easily confused winter crops. A PWRI-based method was applied to the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Valley to map winter rapeseed on the Google Earth Engine platform. Time series composited Sentinel-2 data were used to map winter rapeseed with 10 m resolution.

Because of the effort to ensure the sustainable use of soil resources, demand for current, updatable soil information capable of supporting decisions across scales is increasing. Digital soil mapping (DSM) addresses the drawbacks of conventional soil mapping and has been increasingly used for delivering soil information in a time- and cost-efficient manner with higher spatial resolution, better map accuracy, and quantified uncertainty estimates. We reviewed 244 articles published between January 2003 and July 2021 and then summarised the progress in broad-scale (spatial extent >10,000 km2) DSM, focusing on the 12 mandatory soil properties for GlobalSoilMap. We observed that DSM publications continued to increase exponentially; however, the majority (74.6%) focused on applications rather than methodology development. China, France, Australia, and the United States were the most active countries, and Africa and South America lacked country-based DSM products. Approximately 78% of articles focused on mapping soil organic matter/carbon content and soil organic carbon stocks because of their significant role in food security and climate regulation. Half the articles focused on soil information in topsoil only (<30 cm), and studies on deep soil (100–200 cm) were less represented (21.7%). Relief, organisms, and climate were the three most frequently used environmental covariates in DSM. Nonlinear models (i.e. machine learning) have been increasingly used in DSM for their capacity to manage complex interactions between soil information and environmental covariates. Soil pH was the best predicted soil property (average R2 of 0.60, 0.63, and 0.56 at 0–30, 30–100, and 100–200 cm). Other relatively well-predicted soil properties were clay, silt, sand, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil organic matter (SOM), SOC stocks, and bulk density, and coarse fragments and soil depth were poorly predicted (R2 < 0.28). In addition, decreasing model performance with deeper depth intervals was found for most soil properties. Further research should pursue rescuing legacy data, sampling new data guided by well-designed sampling schemas, collecting representative environmental covariates, improving the performance and interpretability of advanced spatial predictive models, relating performance indicators such as accuracy and precision to cost-benefit and risk assessment analysis for improving decision support; moving from static DSM to dynamic DSM; and providing high-quality, fine-resolution digital soil maps to address global challenges related to soil resources.","2022-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","115567","","","409","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital Soil Mapping; Environmental Covariates; Model Performance and Uncertainty; Predictive Models; Soil Information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Crop yield forecasts can help decision makers to formulate policies on maintaining national food reserves, sustaining food supply chains and attaining national food security. Inter field crop yield heterogeneity arising from varied field management and agricultural practices necessitates this forecasting to be done at field-level. Such field level information can aid farmers to identify gaps in water and farm management practices and take corrective actions, if needed. So far, no scalable tools are available to predict crop yields at field level that leverage the availability of open-access high-resolution RS data. This research implements an operational framework to predict field level crop biomass by evaluating different regression algorithms to develop data driven models, leveraging historical and near real time open-access high resolution optical satellite data from Sentinel-2, radar data from Sentinel-1 and evapotranspiration (ETa) and Net Primary Production (NPP) data from Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Water Productivity through Open-access Remotely sensed data (WaPOR) platform. NPP is used as a proxy for biomass production/yield. Five of the most commonly used regression algorithms were tested to build a data-driven model for sugarcane NPP prediction in Wonji-Shoa sugarcane estate, located in the Awash Basin, Ethiopia. The models tested were the Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Stepwise Multivariate Linear Regression (SMLR), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). The results revealed that for seasonal sugarcane NPP predictions, the linear regression models (MLR and SMLR) yielded more accurate predictions than the non-linear machine learning models (BRT, SVR and RFR) tested. The highest accuracy was achieved for MLR models for which estimates with 89% accuracy could be made 4 months prior to the harvest and with accuracies of 79% up to 200 days (approx. 6.5 months) before the harvest. The non-linear machine learning models, however, could not provide reliable estimates of sugarcane NPP (accuracies < 61%). Cumulative vegetation indices (VIs) were found to have higher predictive power than standard VIs for predicting future sugarcane NPP. Cumulative Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was found to be the variable with the highest predictive power, followed by VH polarized Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data and WaPOR ETa. The study shows the usefulness of high-resolution RS information to predict seasonal NPP at field level. The methods presented here can be translated into an automated framework towards an operational system.","2022-04-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","102725","","","108","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Crop biomass prediction; Cumulated vegetation indices; Data driven models; Food security; Operational framework; Regression algorithms; Remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach employed an unsupervised classification and a tree-based clustering framework, integrating morphological and socio-economic indicators, as well as comprehensive sampling points for slums. Our findings indicate that morphological clusters with compact, small buildings are indicative of a high prevalence of slums, with an accuracy rate of 83.6%. Moreover, these morphological slum clusters exhibit significant correlations with socio-economic indicators, exhibiting lower GDP and wealth index compared to neighbouring clusters.

Although there are some studies that focus on large-scale extraction of coastal aquaculture ponds from satellite images, they have often variable accuracies and encounter misclassification due to the similar geometric characteristics of various vivid water bodies. This paper proposes an efficient and novel method that integrates the spatial characteristics and three biophysical parameters (Chlorophyll-a, Trophic State Index, and Floating Algae Index) to map coastal aquaculture ponds at a national scale. These parameters are derived from bio-optical models based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and time series of high-resolution Sentinel-2 images. Our proposed method effectively addresses the misclassification issue between the aquaculture ponds and rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and salt pans and achieves an overall accuracy of 91 % and a Kappa coefficient of 0.83 in the Chinese coastal zone. Our results indicate that the total area of Chinese coastal aquaculture ponds was 1,039,214 ha in 2019, mainly distributed in the Shandong and Guangdong provinces. The highest aquaculture intensity occurs within the 1 km coastal buffer zone, accounting for 22.4 % of the total area. Furthermore, more than half of the Chinese coastal aquaculture ponds are concentrated in the 0–5 km buffer zone. Our method is of general applicability and thus is suitable for large-scale aquaculture ponds mapping projects. Moreover, the biophysical parameters we employ can be considered as new indicators for the classification of various water bodies even with different aquaculture species.","2022-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","113901","","","181","","Marine Pollution Bulletin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aquaculture ponds; Chlorophyll-a; Google Earth Engine; Remote sensing; Time series","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, to estimate the availability of land surface solar irradiance necessary for solar applications and to model available energy potential, physically-based models drawing on Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) data and associated statistics for key atmospheric constituents, were employed. To assess wind energy resources, model output statistics (MOS) were integrated from post-processed Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) variables, thereby removing any systematic bias arising from long-term regression methods. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) served to compare pyranometer- and satellite-sourced solar radiation, under instantaneous (87.90 W m−2 and 16.84 W m−2, respectively) and daily ‘all sky conditions’ (624.98 Wh m−2 d−1 and 13.89 Wh m−2 d−1, respectively). These low values indicate that satellite-based solar irradiance is sufficiently accurate to be used to model future land surface solar energy in North Korea. In the evaluation of wind energy resources, daily wind speeds obtained from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) reanalysis fields showed good accuracy compared to a meteorological tower measurement (RMSE = 0.37 m s−1 and MBE = 0.24 m s−1). In the study region, mean wind energy potential (from 2013–2015) was 3.44 kWh m−2 d−1, whereas solar energy potential was slightly lower at 3.36 kWh m−2 d−1; this can be attributed to the nation's mountainous terrain and high latitude. Although the region's mountainous terrain may be an obstacle for future development of renewable energy infrastructure, these initial annual mean solar and wind power density results illustrate the significant renewable energy potential of North Korea. This situates the country in a position to promote the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG #7) of integrating cleaner and more sustainable energy resources through solar and wind power.","2020-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","109570","","","119","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","COMS MI satellite; North Korea; Numerical weather prediction (NWP); Renewable energy; Solar energy; Wind energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning-based population estimates are an attractive option but have not been validated for use in epidemiologic studies. Treating 2010 decennial census counts as a “ground truth”, we conduct a case study to compare the performance of alternative small-area population denominator estimates from surrounding years for modeling real-time disease incidence rates. Our case study focuses on modeling health disparities in census tract incidence rates in Massachusetts, using population size estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS), the most commonly-used intercensal small-area population data in epidemiology, and WorldPop, a machine learning model for high-resolution population size estimation. Through simulation studies and an analysis of real premature mortality data, we evaluate whether WorldPop denominators can provide improved performance relative to ACS for quantifying disparities using both census tract-aggregate and race-stratified modeling approaches. We find that biases induced in parameter estimates due to temporally incompatible incidence and denominator data tend to be larger for race-stratified models than for area-aggregate models. In most scenarios considered here, WorldPop denominators lead to greater bias in estimates of health disparities than ACS denominators. These insights will assist researchers in intercensal years to select appropriate population size estimates for modeling disparities in real-time disease incidence. We highlight implications for health disparity studies in the coming decade, as 2020 census counts may introduce new sources of error.","2021-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","100786","","","14","","SSM - Population Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Health disparities; Population denominators; Real-time incidence modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, an all-sky daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) product at 0.05° spatial resolution across Eurasia for 2003–2018 was developed. This product is generated using a satellite-derived model, including parameters such as daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST), downward shortwave radiation, net radiation, leaf area index, enhanced vegetation index, and albedo. The study area, Eurasia, was divided into seven regions using a data-driven method. Four machine learning methods, histogram-based gradient boosting (HGB), extremely randomized trees (ET), random forest (RF), and deep belief network (DBN) were employed to train Tmax estimation models using 4476 stations from GHCN, GSOD, and CMDC. HGB was finally selected since it exhibited the highest estimation accuracy, the determination coefficient (R2) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of the HGB model are 0.984 and 1.736 °C with non-missing values in datasets and 0.985 and 1.812 °C with missing values respectively. The impact of the different situations of LST features on HGB models was tested. LST features containing interpolated LST and GLDAS Ta are considered the best. The spatial and temporal accuracy of HGB models was then examined across different land cover types, latitudes, elevations, and months. The permutation test was employed to examine the contributions of different features. Finally, HGB models trained using the best LST features were used to generate the Tmax products. In comparison with existing temperature products, the R2 and RMSE values were reported as 0.980 and 2.177 °C, indicating strong competition among existing Tmax products.

To confirm this assertion, it is expected that termite mounds would have strong correlations with groundwater conditioning parameters (GCPs). In this study, termite mounds distribution covering an area of about 156 km2 were mapped and their structural characteristics documented with the aim of examining their relationships with twelve (12) chosen GCPs. Other specific objectives were to identify specific mound types with affinity to groundwater and to produce a groundwater potential map of the study area. To achieve this, 12 GCPs including geology, drainage density, lineament density, lineament intersection density, land use/land cover, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope, elevation, plan curvature, static water level and groundwater level fluctuation were extracted from relevant sources. Frequency ratio (FR) and Spearman’s rank correlation were used to find relationships and direction of such relationships. The result revealed a consistent agreement between FR and Spearman’s rank correlation that tall (≥1.8 m) and Cathedral designed mounds are good indicators of groundwater. Further, the groundwater potential map produced from the Random Forest (RF) model via Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) using best-first algorithm depicted an erratic nature of groundwater distribution in the study area. This was then classified using natural break into very-high, high, moderate, low and very low potential classes and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) showed an 86.5% validity of the model. About 75% of mapped termite mounds fell within the very-high to moderate potential classes thereby suggesting that although tall and cathedral mounds in particular showed good correlations with a number of GCPs, high mound density in a locality is also an indication of good groundwater potential.","2019-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","124012","","","578","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frequency ratio; GIS; Groundwater; Random forest; Spearman rank correlation; Termite mounds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, quantifying the climate change contribution to cyanobacterial blooms is difficult, further complicating efforts to set nutrient reduction goals for mitigating blooms in freshwater lakes. This study employed a continuous variable Bayesian modeling framework to develop a model to predict spring cyanobacterial bloom areas and frequencies (the responses) using nutrient levels and climatic factors as predictors. Our results suggested that both spring climatic factors (e.g., increasing temperature and decreasing wind speed) and nutrients (e.g., total phosphorus) played vital roles in spring blooms in Lake Taihu, with climatic factors being the primary drivers for both bloom areas and frequencies. Climate change in spring had a 90% probability of increasing the bloom area from 35 km2 to 180 km2 during our study period, while nutrient reduction limited the bloom area to 170 km2, which helped mitigate expansion of cyanobacterial blooms. For lake management, to ensure a 90% probability of the mean spring bloom areas remaining under 154 km2 (the 75th percentile of the bloom areas in spring), the total phosphorus should be maintained below 0.073 mg·L−1 under current climatic conditions, which is a 46.3% reduction from the current level.

This study aims to examine the spatial-temporal PM2.5 variations in the BRI region, in which area many countries are undergoing rapid urbanization and the main field of future urbanization, to delineate the driving mechanism of PM2.5 accumulation or dissipation. Previous studies have analyzed the PM2.5 distribution at the national level, providing limited information regarding regional heterogeneity in urbanization and PM2.5 concentrations within each country. Additionally, the regional differences in the driving mechanisms of urbanization factors on PM2.5 concentrations have not been thoroughly investigated within the BRI areas. In this study, remote sensing raster data was combined with geographic grid units to examine variations in urbanization and PM2.5 within the BRI region, identifying “typical regions” where urbanization could enhance PM2.5 accumulation. The main results are as follows: i) The spatial autocorrelation of urbanization and PM2.5 concentrations has gradually strengthened, showing consistent high-value distributions in the North China Plain, Ganges Plain and indicating a synergistic growth among emerging developing regions such as China, India, and the Persian Gulf Coast. ii) The correlation between urbanization and PM2.5 concentrations exhibited a distinct trend of differentiation within the BRI regions. The influence of urbanization on PM2.5 changed from agglomeration to dispersion, forming a “typical region” category composed of ten countries, including China, India, and Morocco. iii) The three main urbanization-related factors for PM2.5 accumulation in the “typical regions” for 2005–2016 were energy pollution emission, economic activities, and human activities. By 2023, the effects of energy pollution and economic activities are expected to converge in some “typical region” countries.

Investigations in this domain are mainly academic. This has motivated us to bring a thorough analysis about upgrading to a 3D Moroccan cadastre. Therefore, this research aims to provide guidelines, reflections and recommendations for its implementation, supported by a benchmarking of some best practices around the world. In this paper, the importance of adopting a 3D cadastral system is highlighted, and an overview of the main concepts and approaches of 3D cadastre is presented. Besides, several milestones of 3D cadastre, namely legal, institutional and technical are analyzed. Then, the current status of the Moroccan cadastre with regards to the third dimension is deeply analyzed. In order to propose a suitable 3D cadastral system in the Moroccan context, a gap analysis between the benchmarked countries and the current Moroccan cadastre is performed, through which guidelines for adopting a future 3D cadastre for Morocco with regards to legal, institutional and technical aspects are proposed.

This classification had three classes: no deforestation, old-growth forest loss and secondary forest / plantation loss. The classification map obtained an overall accuracy of 0.97 and an average F1-score of 0.94. The corrected area estimates were 3 195.26 ± 1 132.88 ha (0.48 ± 0.17 %) for the old-growth forest loss and 4 234.85 ± 1 912.01 ha (0.64 ± 0.29 %) for the secondary forest / plantation loss. Most of the classification errors were found in borders between classes, caused by the confusion of secondary forest / plantation loss with herbaceous cover loss or associated with artifacts in the images.","2023-05-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","87-101","","","199","","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Convolutional neural networks (CNN); Forest loss; Land use land cover change (LULCC); Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2; Tropical rainforest; U-Net 3D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The spatial configuration of the dif-ferent components of cities is relevant for at least two main reasons. On the one hand, it encodes many aspects of the phenomena that created such an arrangement in the first place. On the other, once in place, this arrangement of urban form and function underpins many outcomes, from economic productivity to environmental sustainability. Our approach unfolds in three main stages. First, we propose a new spatial unit –the Enclosed Tessellation (ET) cell– to delineate space in a way that is exhaustive and matches the underlying processes at which urban form and function operate. Second, we propose to attach a large variety of form and function-based characters to ET cells to describe each of these units. Third, to build spatial signatures, information on ET cells can be clustered using unsupervised learning techniques. This process results in a theory-informed, data-driven typology of space that follows form and function. We demonstrate the flexibility of the approach to a variety of data landscapes and cultural backgrounds by providing five illustrations of spatial signatures for five cities across five continents. These showcases demonstrate the ability to successfully differentiate areas of a city that were built at different points in time and under different technological regimes, but also highlight broader comparisons about the nature of urban fabric in different regions of the world. Our contribution resides in leveraging modern data, tech-nology and methods to propose a detailed, consistent and scalable methodology that characterises urban form and function. The spatial signatures can be used across academic disciplines and by a variety of practitioners and policymakers supporting initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals.","2022-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","102641","","","128","","Habitat International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Geographic data science; Urban form; Urban function","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current policy framework to ensure the quality of life of inhabitants leaving no one behind, leads decision-makers to seek better-informed choices for the sustainable planning of urban areas. Thus, a better understanding between the spatial structure of cities and their socio-economic level is of crucial relevance. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to quantify this two-way relationship. Therefore, we measured spatial patterns of 31 cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We rely on spatial pattern metrics derived from a Local Climate Zone classification obtained by fusing remote sensing and open GIS data with a machine learning approach. Based upon the data, we quantified the relationship between spatial pattern metrics and socio-economic variables related to ‘education’, ‘health’, ‘living conditions’, ‘labor’, and ‘transport’ by means of multiple linear regression models, explaining the variability of the socio-economic variables from 43% up to 82%. Additionally, we grouped cities according to their level of ‘quality of life’ using the socio-economic variables, and found that the spatial pattern of low-dense built-up types was different among socio-economic groups. The proposed methodology described in this paper is transferable to other datasets, levels, and regions. This is of great potential, due to the growing availability of open statistical and satellite data and derived products. Moreover, we discuss the limitations and needed considerations when conducting such studies.","2021-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","101549","","","85","","Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Local climate zones; Quality of life; Remote sensing; Socio-economic variables; Spatial metrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EnviroAtlas, developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and partners, provides a collection of web-based, interactive maps of environmental and socio-economic data relevant to the SDGs. EnviroAtlas maps ecosystem services indicators at national, regional, and local extents that can contribute to targets set forth in numerous goals, such as SDG 6 for clean water, SDG 11 for sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 15 for life on land. Examples of EnviroAtlas indicators that provide a way to view spatial inequalities, help fill gaps in environmental indicators, and integrate socio-economic and environmental data for the SDGs are explored herein. Remotely sensed EO data are essential for producing these indicators and informing planning and decision-making for the SDGs at subnational scales. The National Land Cover Dataset is the basis for many EnviroAtlas maps at the national extent, while National Agriculture Imagery Program and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are used to classify Meter-scale Urban Land Cover in select US metro areas. These 30 m and 1 m land cover products are combined with demographic and other geospatial data (remotely sensed and otherwise) to produce integrated indicators that can aid in target setting of the SDGs. Though EnviroAtlas was created for the conterminous US, the methods for indicator creation are transferable, and the open-source code for the EnviroAtlas resource may serve as an example for other nations. Achieving the SDGs means assessing targets and decision-making outcomes at local, regional, and national levels using consistent and accurate data. Geospatial resources like EnviroAtlas that provide open access to indicators based on EO data and allow for assessment at multiple extents and resolutions are critical to broadly addressing national to subnational SDG goals and targets.","2020-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:41","2024-01-19 10:23:41","","111796","","","244","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EnviroAtlas; Geospatial indicators; Green space; SDG; Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dozens of indices have been proposed to date, but systematic validation against classical, in situ diversity measures are lacking. This study conducted the most comprehensive comparative evaluation to date of the relationship between avian species diversity and a suite of acoustic indices. Acoustic surveys were carried out across habitat gradients in temperate and tropical biomes. Baseline avian species richness and subjective multi-taxa biophonic density estimates were established through aural counting by expert ornithologists. 26 acoustic indices were calculated and compared to observed variations in species diversity. Five acoustic diversity indices (Bioacoustic Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Acoustic Evenness Index, Acoustic Entropy, and the Normalised Difference Sound Index) were assessed as well as three simple acoustic descriptors (Root-mean-square, Spectral centroid and Zero-crossing rate). Highly significant correlations, of up to 65%, between acoustic indices and avian species richness were observed across temperate habitats, supporting the use of automated acoustic indices in biodiversity monitoring where a single vocal taxon dominates. Significant, weaker correlations were observed in neotropical habitats which host multiple non-avian vocalizing species. Multivariate classification analyses demonstrated that each habitat has a very distinct soundscape and that AIs track observed differences in habitat-dependent community composition. Multivariate analyses of the relative predictive power of AIs show that compound indices are more powerful predictors of avian species richness than any single index and simple descriptors are significant contributors to avian diversity prediction in multi-taxa tropical environments. Our results support the use of community level acoustic indices as a proxy for species richness and point to the potential for tracking subtler habitat-dependent changes in community composition. Recommendations for the design of compound indices for multi-taxa community composition appraisal are put forward, with consideration for the requirements of next generation, low power remote monitoring networks.","2018-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:42","2024-01-19 10:23:42","","939-952","","","95","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Acoustic indices; Biodiversity monitoring; Ecoacoustics; Remote sensing; Species richness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The basin spans two countries, Russia and Mongolia, which, along with its vastness, makes it challenging to accurately automate the acquisition of large-scale and long-term series data. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) is capable of processing large amounts of remote sensing imagery but does not support the computation and application of deep learning models. This study uses a combination of local deep learning training and GEE cloud-based big data intelligent computing to empower GEE with deep learning computing power, enabling it to rapidly automate the deployment of deep learning models. Visible light, near infrared (NIR), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), short-wave infrared 1 (SWIR1), linear enhancement band (LEB), and digital elevation model (DEM), which are more sensitive to water bodies, were selected as input features, along with the optimized input features of the existing pixel-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model. This method corrects the initial water labels from the Landsat quality assessment bands to reduce the time cost of manually drawing the labels and improving the classification accuracy of the water bodies. On average, only 1–2 h are required to generate the results for each water body product for each period in Lake Baikal Basin. The extraction of water bodies from the Lake Baikal Basin was achieved for nine yearly periods between 2013 and 2021. The validation accuracy was 92.9 %, 92.7 %, and 92.4 % for the three years 2013, 2017 and 2021, respectively. The results showed that the mean area of water bodies in the basin was 37,500 km2 and that the area of water bodies in the basin fluctuated without significant change from 2013 to 2021.

In this study, validation of two groups of TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) SIF products, namely TROPOSIFCaltech (containing far-red and red TROPOSIFCaltech datasets) and TROPOSIFESA (containing TROPOSIF735 and TROPOSIF743 datasets that are retrieved from two different retrieval windows), was conducted using tower-based SIF measurements over seven sites. Several issues and potential obstacles emerged while matching satellite-based and in situ SIF retrievals, including spatial scale mismatch. To overcome the spatial scale mismatch between the satellite data and ground observations, a near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)-scaled approach was employed to mitigate the spatial difference between the locations of specific sites and the matched TROPOSIF samples using Sentinel-2 imagery. Other issues related to retrival methods and instrument differences were examined. Subsequently, the 3FLD retrieval method was chosed for the in situ data. The validation results showed that the three far-red TROPOSIF datasets exhibit slightly different performances in terms of the validation accuracy; the R2 for TROPOSIFCaltech, TROPOSIF735, and TROPOSIF743 was 0.43, 0.33 and 0.40, respectively, which is asociated with root-mean-square error(RMSE) values of 0.59, 0.42 and 0.57 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1, respectively. However, red TROPOSIFCaltech exhibited no significant correlation with tower-based SIF with R2 of 0.02 and RMSE of 0.34 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1. Furthermore, the validation results at different sites varied, with R2 ranging from 0.01 to 0.70. Uncertainties still exist in the validation of the four TROPOSIF datasets, which are attributed to some unresolved issues, such as the limited quality of in situ SIF retrievals and the spatial scaling difference.

Reducing poverty has become a crucial objective for global sustainable development. Timely and consistently monitoring poverty status plays a vital role in evaluating the efficiency of poverty reduction policies. Nighttime light images from satellites allow for frequent monitoring of poverty status by recording lighting intensity. The coarse spatial resolution of the recent, widely used, publicly available nighttime light images hinders research on smaller unit scales, such as county-level. The SDGSAT-1 satellite, with a glimmer sensor and a spatial resolution of 10-m, was launched in 2021 to meet the sustainable development goals. This study proposes a model to sharpen the existing nighttime light images with a coarse spatial resolution to expand the available period of nighttime light images with a 10-m spatial resolution in discriminating illuminating ground objects. The expanded nighttime light images with discriminated illuminating ground objects are then utilized to calculate the time-series county-level poverty index for three typical Chinese urban agglomerations with a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.675 (p < 0.01). Compared to the poverty statistics derived from the Chinese county statistical yearbook, the estimated poverty index can explore county-level poverty status change more effectively by completing the missing census. The time-series county-level poverty analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of Chinese endeavor in poverty reduction. >90% of the counties experienced a reduction in poverty in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region due to time-series economic development. Statistical analysis of the poverty index of impoverished counties demonstrates a remarkable reduction of poverty in the study areas and the significance of the persistent poverty reduction policy implementation.

Benefiting from local spatial perception, deep learning based object extraction methods have achieved satisfactory performances in extracting geo-objects. However, they fail to work for large-scale greenhouse extraction since the objects are sparsely distributed in the background and densely distributed in the foreground, where the local spatial perception causes redundant computation and false detection problems. In this paper, we propose a layout attention network (LANet) framework for large-scale greenhouse extraction using remote sensing imagery, which replaces the local spatial perception with spatial layout perception, i.e., a sparse global layout to identify the sparse background and a dense local layout to identify the dense foreground. To address the shortcoming of the sparse background, which leads to redundant computation, a sparse global layout awareness module is formulated as a scene classifier. This accommodates the global layout attention map of the global scene features by adopting a layout-shared convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone for generating class-agnostic layout priors and global channel attention for aggregating discriminative global layout features, ensuring robust sparse background identification. Then, to alleviate the problem of the dense foreground, which causes false detection, a dense local layout awareness module is proposed to incorporate the local layout attention map and rotated region of interest (RRoI) features. The RRoI features are then further embedded to guide the initial RRoIs for object location refinement by aligning the initial RRoI locations in a layout-sensitive attention mechanism and achieving semantic enhancement by taking the local layout density as a semantic prior to assign a reliable class score map. The experimental results obtained on an agricultural greenhouse benchmark dataset and a large-scale agricultural greenhouse extraction dataset illustrate that the proposed framework can outperform the state-of-the-art object extraction methods in both speed and accuracy, and has a high generalization ability for large-scale dense object extraction.","2023-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:42","2024-01-19 10:23:42","","73-88","","","200","","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dense foreground; Large-scale greenhouse extraction; Layout attention; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing imagery; Sparse background","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vegetation heterogeneity in GDEs requires routine monitoring in order to conserve and preserve the ecosystem services in these environments. However, in–situ monitoring of vegetation heterogeneity in extensive, or transboundary, groundwater resources remain a challenge. Inherently, the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) and remotely-sensed data provide a unique way to monitor the response of GDEs to seasonal or intra–annual environmental stressors, which is the key for achieving the national and regional biodiversity targets. This study presents the first attempt at monitoring the intra–annual, spatio–temporal variations in vegetation heterogeneity in the Khakea–Bray Transboundary Aquifer, which is located between Botswana and South Africa, by using the coefficient of variation derived from the Landsat 8 OLI Operational Land Imager (OLI). The coefficient of variation was used to measure spectral heterogeneity, which is a function of environmental heterogeneity. Heterogenous environments are more diverse, compared to homogenous environments, and the vegetation heterogeneity can be inferred from the heterogeneity of a landscape. The coefficient of variation was used to calculate the α- and β measures of vegetation heterogeneity (the Shannon–Weiner Index and the Rao's Q, respectively), whilst the monotonic trends in the spatio–temporal variation (January–December) of vegetation heterogeneity were derived by using the Mann–Kendall non–parametric test. Lastly, to explain the spatio–temporal variations of vegetation heterogeneity, a set of environmental variables were used, along with a machine-learning algorithm (random forest). The vegetation heterogeneity was observed to be relatively high during the wet season and low during the dry season, and these changes were mainly driven by landcover- and climate–related variables. More specifically, significant changes in vegetation heterogeneity were observed around natural water pans, along roads and rivers, as well as in cropping areas. Furthermore, these changes were better predicted by the Rao's Q (MAE = 5.81, RMSE = 6.63 and %RMSE = 42.41), than by the Shannon–Weiner Index (MAE = 30.37, RMSE = 33.25 and %RMSE = 63.94). These observations on the drivers and changes in vegetation heterogeneity provide new insights into the possible effects of future landcover changes and climate variability on GDEs. This information is imperative, considering that these environments are biodiversity hotspots that are capable of supporting many livelihoods. More importantly, this work provides a spatially explicit framework on how GDEs can be monitored to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Number 15.","2022-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:42","2024-01-19 10:23:42","","101667","","","69","","Ecological Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Khakea–bray; Random forest; Rao's Q; Shannon–Weiner; Spectral variation hypothesis (SVH); Vegetation heterogeneity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The non-native tree establishment in the northern tropical edge, or the non-traditional suitable planting area, provides stable supplies of natural latex, yet also leads to severe ecological degradation and environmental effects in water conservation, soil quality, rainforest fragmentation and biodiversity. Rubber plantations in the northern part of MSEA are normally characterized by periodic deciduous during the dry season, along with a lengthy defoliation-foliation duration, because of seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation. It thus lays a phenological and physiological base for dynamics monitoring with common multispectral (e.g., near-infrared and short-wave infrared bands) satellites, particularly Landsat. However, whether Sentinel-2 red-edge based algorithms are suitable for discriminating rubber plantations is not yet exclusively reported. Here, we developed a red-edge spectral indices (RESI) method through the normalization of three red-edge bands and applied it to identify and map rubber plantations in Luang Namtha Province of northern Laos, where a rubber boom begun in the mid-2000s. The RESI algorithm highlights the sensitivity of red-edge bands to the changes in moisture content and canopy density of rubber plantations. The area of mature rubber plantations was estimated to be 771.2 km2 in this province bordering southwest China in 2018, which was nearly twice as much as that of 2011, with the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient up to 92.50% and 0.91, respectively.

Thus, timely and accurate monitoring of photovoltaic solar power plants is crucial to the design and management of renewable electricity systems in China. Random forest algorithm has been used to map photovoltaic solar power plants at multiple scales, however, it always causes several salt-and-pepper noises, limiting its application at larger spatial scales. Here we first develop a photovoltaic solar power plant mapping method through integrating time series Landsat imagery, random forest, and morphological characteristics. Then we apply this method in Gansu Province, which has abundant solar and wind energy resources and provide large amounts of potential lands for photovoltaic development, and generate the annual photovoltaic maps from 2015 to 2020. We further analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of sizes and areas of photovoltaic solar power plants and major land cover conversion of expansive photovoltaic regions. Finally, we discuss the reliability, uncertainties, implications, and future development of our improved methods.

Currently, the contributions of multispectral infrared observations to precipitation estimation have not been fully understood thus far. Motivated by estimating precipitation based on real-time data from geostationary satellites, this study proposes the Precipitation Estimation using Chromatographic Analysis (PECA) methodology based on full-disc observations from Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) of FengYun-4A (FY-4A). Compared with PERSIANN-CCS and FY4AQPE-Official, the results of PECA (PECA-FY4A) are comprehensively evaluated against the GSOD (global gauge data), CMS (Chinese gauge data) and IMERG-LR (micro-wave precipitation products) for the period from January, 2019 to November, 2021. The findings and conclusions mainly include but are not limited to the following: (1) PECA clearly reveals that T12, ∆T10−14, ∆T7−14, and ∆T7−8 are effective for estimating precipitation volumes, with strong correlation to precipitation volumes but significantly less redundant information. (2) IR band differences are still sensitive to heavy precipitation although the abilities of single IR bands have become insufficient. For example, ∆T7−8 are sensitive to heavy precipitation in the eye walls of the typhoons. (3) The evaluation results show that PERSIANN-CCS generally outperforms FY4AQPE-Official, while PECA-FY4A features significant improvements over PERSIANN-CCS (the international benchmark of IR precipitation products) in terms of CC (∼10%, ∼100%, and ∼ 21%), RMSE (∼20%, ∼36%, and ∼ 11%), and CSI (∼25%, ∼100%, and ∼ 12%) against IMERG-LR, CMS and GSOD, respectively.

Soil disaggregation techniques are commonly used to improve the spatial and attribute precision of CSMs. DSMART is a popular but computationally intensive method, as it generates and assigns synthetic samples to soil series based on the CSMs’ areal coverage information. Alternatively, Pure Polygon Disaggregation (PPD) assigns soil series based solely on the proportion of soil series in pure polygons (polygons with a single soil series) across the CSM area. This study compared these two techniques by applying them to a CSM of Middlesex County, Canada. Four different sampling methods were used: two sampling designs (simple random sampling, SRS and conditional Latin hypercube sampling, cLHS) with two sample sizes (83,100 and 19,420) per sampling plan, both based on an area-weighted approach. A C5.0 decision tree and random forest (RF) were applied to all the disaggregation approaches to compare the result accuracy. The accuracy assessment utilized a set of five hundred validation points obtained from the Middlesex County soil survey report. C5.0 showed better performance (Kappa 0.58 to 0.63) than RF (0.53–0.54) with a larger sample size, and PPD with C5.0 using a larger sample size was the best performing (Kappa 0.63) approach. With a smaller sample size, both cLHS (Kappa 0.41 to 0.48) and SRS (0.40–0.47) produced similar accuracy results. Pure Polygon Disaggregation exhibited lower computational and time demands (1.62–5.93 hours) while yielding maps with lower uncertainty as compared to DSMART (2.75–194.2 hours).

Here we studied the world's ninth largest river basin, the Amur River Basin (ARB), with a land area of 2.08 million km2. Our objectives were to address the information deficiencies of spatially explicit wetland distributions and their changes and to quantify the proximate causes of these changes in various periods in the ARB. A hybrid approach combining object-based and hierarchical decision-trees classification (HOHC) was applied to Landsat series images to obtain multitemporal land cover datasets from 1980 to 2016. Further quantitative analysis revealed that the ARB held 184,561 km2 of wetlands in 2016, accounting for 9% of the whole basin area. Among these, 59% of the wetlands were identified on the Russian side, while 40% were on the Chinese side, and 1% were on the Mongolian side. The ARB lost 22% of its wetland (52,246 km2) from 1980 to 2016, with a consistent net loss from 1980 to 2010 but an area gain from 2010 to 2016. Human activities dominated the consistent wetland losses on the Chinese side of the ARB, of which cropland expansion was the primary proximate cause of wetland loss (69%). Conversely, the wetlands on the Russian side had consistent losses from 1980 to 2010 followed by a gain from 2010 to 2016, which could be attributed to climate change. These quantified data will inform decision-making on wetland conservation and benefit scientific studies depending on spatially explicit wetland information.","2021-02-15","2024-01-19 10:23:42","2024-01-19 10:23:42","","111670","","","280","","Journal of Environmental Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cropland expansion; Remote sensing; SDGs; The Amur River Basin; Wetlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The existing conventional data collection has been focusing on field survey methods which require considerable human resources and costs, long collection and processing times, and have difficulty in reaching remote areas. Remote sensing with satellite imagery and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can be an alternative due to its advantages which include a more efficient workforce, shorter update times, comprehensive area coverage, and the ability to reach remote locations. In this study, we propose the utilization of Microsoft Bing Maps Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and UAV with image processing threshold and object-based deep learning methods to detect and count the number of oil palm trees. Experimental results in a case study in Rokan Hulu Regency, Riau, Indonesia show that the object-based deep learning model of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture achieves excellent performance with an F1-Score of up to 91.05%. This model is superior to the widely adopted baseline model of the image processing threshold, which only reached an F1-Score of 40.59%.

The integrated analysis of these collections requires considerable effort by researchers who have to download, organize and harmonize them in their local computers, facing with different spatiotemporal resolutions and classification systems containing distinct class numbers, names and meanings. Besides that, these collections are distributed in different data formats through files or web services. To minimize these efforts, we propose a platform that allows users to access LULC collections from distinct sources, map their distinct classification systems, and retrieve LULC trajectories associated with spatial locations by integrating these collections.

Moreover, woody-biomass stores a very good amount of carbon dioxide as about fifty percent of living organisms are built from carbon. The objective of this study is to estimate the above and belowground woody biomass and carbon stock of Kunzila watershed, Northwest Ethiopia as a piece of baseline information so as to gage the changes after the intervention. The watershed covers about 11,200 ha of land with undulating topographic landscapes. More than 230 sample plots of 30 m by 30 m were surveyed and every woody plant (shrub/bush and tree) was measured. Allometric equations were applied to calculate biomass and carbon stock potential at the plot level. The Random forest algorithm was applied to upscale plot values to watershed level. The results indicate that Kunzila watershed offers maximum biomass of 1,756(±249) Mt year−1/watershed and corresponding carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) of 3,022(±429) Mt C year−1 /watershed with the current vegetation status; while the average woody biomass and CO2e were estimated about 244(±249) Mt ha−1 year−1 and 425(±429) Mt C ha−1 year−1, respectively. These results indicate that there are high variabilities among different ecosystem types and also the watershed generally offers below its potential. However, there is a high potential to achieve up to triples of biomass and CO2e by implementing recommended intervention plans developed out of the current study. The current approach using machine learning algorithm to upscale from sample plot-level to watershed scale is a very good one and can be applied to other watersheds at scale.","2022-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:42","2024-01-19 10:23:42","","100204","","","7","","Trees, Forests and People","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Allometric equation; Carbon stock; COe; Ethiopia; Kunzila watershed; Random forest algorithm; Woody biomass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, our existing knowledge on the patterns of built environment stocks across and particularly within cities is limited, largely owing to the lack of sufficient high spatial resolution data. This study leveraged multi-source big geodata, machine learning, and bottom-up stock accounting to characterize the built environment stocks of 50 cities in China at 500 m fine-grained levels. The per capita built environment stock of many cities (240 tonnes per capita on average) is close to that in western cities, despite considerable disparities across cities owing to their varying socioeconomic, geomorphology, and urban form characteristics. This is mainly owing to the construction boom and the building and infrastructure-driven economy of China in the past decades. China’s urban expansion tends to be more “vertical” (with high-rise buildings) than “horizontal” (with expanded road networks). It trades skylines for space, and reflects a concentration–dispersion–concentration pathway for spatialized built environment stocks development within cities in China. These results shed light on future urbanization in developing cities, inform spatial planning, and support circular and low-carbon transitions in cities.","2023-07-05","2024-01-19 10:23:42","2024-01-19 10:23:42","","","","","","","Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","big geodata; built environment stock; spatial pattern; urban sustainability; urban system engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ecological models can play a key role in supporting this need and helping to safeguard the natural assets that underpin human wellbeing and support life on land and below water (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; SDG 15 & 14). The urgency and complexity of safeguarding forest (SDG 15.2) and mountain ecosystems (SDG 15.4), for example, and halting decline in biodiversity (SDG 15.5) in the Anthropocene requires a re-envisioning of how ecological models can best support the comprehensive assessments of biodiversity and its change that are required for successful action. A key opportunity to advance ecological modeling for both predictive and explanatory purposes arises through a collaboration between ecologists and the Earth observation community, and a close integration of remote sensing and species distribution models. Remote sensing products have the capacity to provide continuous spatiotemporal information about key factors driving the distribution of organisms, therefore improving both the use and accuracy of these models for management and planning. Here we first survey the literature on remote sensing data products available to ecological modelers interested in improving predictions of species range dynamics under global change. We specifically explore the key biophysical processes underlying the distribution of species in the Anthropocene including climate variability, changes in land cover, and disturbances. We then discuss potential synergies between the ecological modeling and remote sensing communities, and highlight opportunities to close the data and conceptual gaps that currently impede a more effective application of remote sensing for the monitoring and modeling of ecological systems. Specific attention is given to how potential collaborations between the two communities could lead to new opportunities to report on progress towards global agendas - such as the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development of the United Nations or the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework of the Convention for Biological Diversity, and help guide conservation and management strategies towards sustainability.","2020-03-15","2024-01-19 10:23:42","2024-01-19 10:23:42","","111626","","","239","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anthropocene; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Species distribution models; Sustainable development; Terrestrial ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It argues for more emphasis on ecological and fisheries regeneration, and maximising societal benefits rather than yields. Three recommendations are provided: (1) an integrated and more holistic Fisheries-Energy-Environment Nexus resource management approach would better utilise systems thinking to optimise trade-offs and synergies between competing domains to achieve fisheries, conservation and other environmental goals (e.g. delivering the national net zero strategy); (2) the use of best available technologies as is reasonably practicable to monitor compliance and facilitate enforcement should be a regulatory requirement under the JFS; (3) the fisheries and marine conservation science community should work with other stakeholders to change the media narrative, public opinion, and political direction away from a “business-as-usual” model that risks long-term degradation of the marine fisheries resource.","2023-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:42","2024-01-19 10:23:42","","105335","","","147","","Marine Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Environmental Awareness; Fisheries Act; Fisheries Economics; Food-Energy-Environment Nexus; Political Engagement; Remote Electronic Monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we integrated predictive soil mapping paradigm with adaptive depth function fitting, state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning and high-resolution soil-forming environment characterization in a high-performance parallel computing environment to generate 90-m resolution national gridded maps of nine soil properties (pH, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, cation exchange capacity, bulk density, coarse fragments, and thickness) at multiple depths across China. This was based on approximately 5000 representative soil profiles collected in a recent national soil survey and a suite of detailed covariates to characterize soil-forming environments. The predictive accuracy ranged from very good to moderate (Model Efficiency Coefficients from 0.71 to 0.36) at 0–5 cm. The predictive accuracy for most soil properties declined with depth. Compared with previous soil maps, we achieved significantly more detailed and accurate predictions which could well represent soil variations across the territory and are a significant contribution to the GlobalSoilMap.net project.

Twelve conditional factors and two important ensemble algorithms including Probability density-Index of entropy (PD-IOE) and Frequency ratio-Index of entropy (FR-IOE), were used to produce rangeland downward trend (RDT) susceptibility maps. The results of validation showed that PD-IOE hybrid model with area under curve (AUC = 0.901) and standard error (SE = 0.011) is more accurate than FR-IOE hybrid model (AUC = 0.881 and SE = 0.012).

This pilot study used unmanned aerial vehicle imagery, aimed to monitor litter loads (illegal dumps and individual littered items) over a large land area (> 2 km2) to assess potential change in litter through time. Two techniques, the Percentage Cover Technique and the Comparison Technique, were used. The two techniques were trialed at five sites to quantify litter load and monitor change over time. Overall, through the Percentage Cover Technique, 13.5% of the study area was covered in litter in February 2020, and this decreased to 10.3% by July 2021. All five sites individually showed a decrease in litter loads, with significant differences between imagery sets (H(2) = 52.786, P < 0.001) and between surveyors (U = 15 567 399, n1=n2=5 211, P < 0.001 two-tailed). The Comparison Technique revealed that of the 10 422 blocks analysed in this study, litter coverage decreased in 10.3% and increased in 8.3%, of them. The study showed that the Comparison Technique is an easy and inexpensive method to monitor litter loads on large scales and could therefore be replicated across Africa which has limited resources (financial and expertise).","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:43","2024-01-19 10:23:43","","100753","","","13","","Environmental Challenges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dumping; Image inspection; Litter loads; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past decades, a series of African cropland maps have been derived from remotely-sensed data, existing comparison studies have shown that inconsistencies with statistics and discrepancies among these products are considerable. Yet, there is a knowledge gap about the factors that influence their consistency. The aim of this study is thus to estimate the consistency of five widely-used cropland datasets (MODIS Collection 5, GlobCover 2009, GlobeLand30, CCI-LC 2010, and Unified Cropland Layer) in Africa, and to explore the effects of several limiting factors (landscape fragmentation, climate and agricultural management) on spatial consistency. The results show that total cropland area for Africa derived from GlobeLand30 has the best fitness with FAO statistics, followed by MODIS Collection 5. GlobCover 2009, CCI-LC 2010, and Unified Cropland Layer have poor performances as indicated by larger deviations from statistics. In terms of spatial consistency, disagreement is about 37.9 % at continental scale, and the disparate proportion even exceeds 50 % in approximately 1/3 of the countries at national scale. We further found that there is a strong and significant correlation between spatial agreement and cropland fragmentation, suggesting that regions with higher landscape fragmentation generally have larger disparities. It is also noticed that places with better consistency are mainly distributed in regions with favorable natural environments and sufficient agricultural management such as well-developed irrigated technology. Proportions of complete agreement are thus located in favorable climate zones including Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), Subtropical highland climate (Cwb), and Temperate Mediterranean climate (Csb). The level of complete agreement keeps rising as the proportion of irrigated cropland increases. Spatial agreement among these datasets has the most significant relationship with cropland fragmentation, and a relatively small association with irrigation area, followed by climate conditions. These results can provide some insights into understanding how different factors influence the consistency of cropland datasets, and making an appropriate selection when using these datasets in different regions. We suggest that future cropland mapping activities should put more effort in those regions with significant disagreement in Sub-Saharan Africa.","2020-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:43","2024-01-19 10:23:43","","102087","","","89","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Accuracy assessment; Cropland mapping; Fragmentation; Global land cover; Spatial agreement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The spatial and temporal evaluation of the flood susceptibility was explored in the Quebec basin, Canada. This study provides a new strategy for runoff modelling as one of the complicated variables by developing new machine learning techniques along with remote sensing. A novel scheme of the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) known as the generalized structure of GMDH (GSGGMDH) is developed to overcome this classical approach's limitation. A simple time series based scenario with exogenous variables including precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was introduced for runoff forecasting. MODIS data included MOD13Q1 product was employed and a JavaScript code was developed to preprocess collected data in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. Using different seasonal and non-seasonal lags of all input variables, the developed GSGMDH found the most optimum input combination for each station in terms of simplicity and accuracy, simultaneously (average values; SI = 0.554, RMSRE = 1.55, MAE = 5.076). The precipitation values are modelled with the CanEsm2 climate change model. To apply NDVI for runoff forecasting, a simple spatial-temporal GSGMDH based model was developed (average values; SI = 0.27; RMSRE = 8.27, MAE = 0.08). The forecasting results indicated that the months in which the maximum runoff occurred have changed, and these months have increased compared to the historic period. In the historical period, the frequency of maximum runoff was in April and March. Still, for the two forecasting periods (i.e. 2020–2039 and 2040–2059), the months in which the maximum runoff has occurred have changed, and their amount has been reduced and added to other months, especially February and August.","2021-05-20","2024-01-19 10:23:43","2024-01-19 10:23:43","","145288","","","770","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Generalized Structure of Group Method of Data Handling (GSGMDH); Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Remote sensing; Runoff time series; Water resources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the cropland expansion took place in Brazil the last decades, leading to significant land-use change and environmental impacts, detailed information about soils is fundamental for sustainable development. Thus, considering the lack of spatially explicit information about cropland soils in Brazil, we aimed at performing high-resolution mapping of key topsoil attributes using spectral and terrain features extracted from Earth observation data (EOD). With the resulting information, we also aimed at performing a general examination of the main agricultural regions and estimate the total organic carbon stocks on croplands soils. For this, we obtained environmental predictors from the historical collection of Landsat data and the digital elevation model from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission at the cloud-based platform of Google Earth Engine. The environmental predictors (30 m spatial resolution) with georeferenced soil samples (n = 5097) were used for predicting the topsoil content (0–20 cm) of clay, sand, silt, cation exchange capacity, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) and SOC stock. Prediction models of clay, sand, SOC content, and SOC stocks had the best performance metrics, achieving a R2 ranging from 0.44 to 0.74 and ratio of performance to the interquartile range higher than 1.5. The predicted maps revealed the variability of topsoil among the cropped areas, indicating that the agricultural expansion took place on sandy soils. The SOC stock map provided consistent estimates compared to previous datasets but revealed additional information at the local and regional scales. Thus, this study supports the proposition that EOD is a valuable source for extracting environmental features for mapping and monitoring cropland soils at finer resolutions, assisting the evaluation of soil spatial distribution and the historical agriculture expansion over large geographical areas.","2021-08-15","2024-01-19 10:23:43","2024-01-19 10:23:43","","115042","","","396","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bare soil composite; Croplands; Digital soil mapping; Google Earth engine; Machine learning; Remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal changes of LULC and their impacts on the water quality of a river flowing through a rapidly developed area in China. Then, a cellular automata-Markov model was established to predict the LULC, which was used as a key indicator to predict future water quality by a multiple linear regression model.

The biochemical oxygen demand in five days (BOD5), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) exhibited significantly positive correlations with construction land, while dissolved oxygen (DO) showed a significantly negative correlation with construction land. The DO exhibited a significantly positive correlation with the number of patch (NP), but TN and TP showed significantly negative correlations with NP. The water quality prediction model based on LULC performed well, especially TN prediction has a coefficient of determination of 0.691 and a mean relative error of 12.14%.

We observed significantly decreasing water storage trends in the GRACE data, which were underestimated by the GHMs. After averaging the three GRACE satellite datasets, we found that the water storage was decreasing at a rate of −4.74 mm/year. Contrary to the prevailing declining water storage trends, northeastern Kazakhstan (KAZ), and southern Xinjiang increased their water storage over the same period. The GRACE data showed that Turkmenistan (TKM), Uzbekistan (UZB) and KAZ experienced the most severe water depletions, while Tajikistan (TJK) and northwest China (NW) experienced the least significant depletions. With respect to the major river and lake basins, the Aral Sea Basin exhibited the most serious water loss (-0.60 mm/month to −0.38 mm/month). The water storage positively correlates with the precipitation; and negatively correlates, with a three-month lag, with temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET). Partial least square regression (PLSR) had the high capability in simulating and predicting the TWS.

It would be desirable for hazard mitigation planning and sustainable urban design if potential waterlogging-prone areas under dynamic land use change could be appropriately predicted. However, previous related studies did not simultaneously consider the reliability of negative samples and the future influence of fine-scale land use change. To fill the knowledge gap, this research has developed a robust method for predicting future waterlogging-prone areas by coupling the maximum entropy (MAXENT) and the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. The former can ensure that no extra sampling bias will be introduced, while the latter can accurately forecast the spatio-temporal pattern of land use. This case study has confirmed the accuracy and feasibility of this method. It was found that the proportion of impervious surfaces, population density, and proportion of green areas are key spatial drivers behind urban waterlogging issues. In addition, the future hazard potential map provided by the MAXENT and FLUS implies that a large proportion of impervious surfaces will face huge waterlogging risks.

With an estimated 1 billion slum dwellers globally, the United Nations have made the fight against poverty the number one sustainable development goal. To provide better infrastructure and thus a better life to slum dwellers, detailed information on the spatial location and size of slums is of crucial importance. In the past, remote sensing has proven to be an extremely valuable and effective tool for mapping slums. The nature of used mapping approaches by machine learning, however, made it necessary to invest a lot of effort in training the models. Recent advances in deep learning allow for transferring trained fully convolutional networks (FCN) from one data set to another. Thus, in our study we aim at analyzing transfer learning capabilities of FCNs to slum mapping in various satellite images. A model trained on very high resolution optical satellite imagery from QuickBird is transferred to Sentinel-2 and TerraSAR-X data. While free-of-charge Sentinel-2 data is widely available, its comparably lower resolution makes slum mapping a challenging task. TerraSAR-X data on the other hand, has a higher resolution and is considered a powerful data source for intra-urban structure analysis. Due to the different image characteristics of SAR compared to optical data, however, transferring the model could not improve the performance of semantic segmentation but we observe very high accuracies for mapped slums in the optical data: QuickBird image obtains 86–88% (positive prediction value and sensitivity) and a significant increase for Sentinel-2 applying transfer learning can be observed (from 38 to 55% and from 79 to 85% for PPV and sensitivity, respectively). Using transfer learning proofs extremely valuable in retrieving information on small-scaled urban structures such as slum patches even in satellite images of decametric resolution.","2019-04-01","2024-01-19 10:23:43","2024-01-19 10:23:43","","59-69","","","150","","ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; FCN; Slums; Transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study introduces an improved two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method to accurately assess park accessibility and spatial equity in Guangzhou, considering the 15-minute city perspective. Firstly, a more effective framework is proposed to identify multiple park entrances that serve as supply points. Secondly, the population distribution is estimated using building areas and locationbased data through a random forest model. Furthermore, the supply capability index is estimated by considering the area of each park and its attractiveness index, derived from multiple geographic data sources. The results reveal unequal park accessibility in Guangzhou, with low-access areas mainly distributed on the fringe of study area in both walking and cycling scenarios due to the limited park supply or high-density population. With the influences of park entrances and the park attractiveness index, the spatial inequity of park accessibility may be more severe than previously estimated in other studies. This work enhances the understanding of park accessibility and facilitate effective planning for sustainable development and reducing environmental injustice.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:43","2024-01-19 10:23:43","","104824","","","98","","Sustainable Cities and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15-minute city; Accessibility; Environmental equity; Two-step floating catchment area method (2SFCA); Urban parks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, the resolution of the original hyperspectral imagery is enhanced via a deep learning-based super-resolution method. Then we introduce a feature fusion method by combining multi-dimensional features including elevation, reflectance, biochemistry, principal component analysis, and fast-Fourier transform features to enhance the feature sensitivity to the aquaculture ponds. The aquaculture ponds are finally extracted via a step-wise extraction strategy. Experiments on ZH-1 and GF-7 imageries are conducted, and the experimental results show that our method achieves an OA of 97.9% on the aquaculture pond extraction and that the method can be generalized for the object extraction on multispectral datasets.

Current long-term change projections are often based on changes to mangrove extent; however, this may overlook fragmentation and the associated habitat resilience decline and therefore fail to adequately reveal the risks to mangrove habitats. A mangrove sustainability index (MSI) was proposed in this study to assess the impact of SLR and land use on mangrove habitats. The index consists of four components: habitat area change, habitat quality, landscape pattern, and protection ratio. Ecological models and landscape models were combined to calculate the MSI. Considering the SLR under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and land use strategies, four scenarios were set with prediction periods of base year (2020) to 2050 and 2100. The Leizhou Peninsula, China was used as the case study. The results showed that dual stressors would reduce the extent of mangroves by 16.6%–56.2%. Habitat quality was sensitive to land use change but was not affected by SLR. Landscape pattern and protection ratio were influenced by SLR but less effected by land use. In all scenarios, mangroves tended to migrate out of the protected areas, with protection ratio decreasing from 37% to 16.9%–29.9%. Newly expanding habitats may suffer from patch fragmentation and low connectivity. Unsustainable mangrove distribution sites on Leizhou Peninsula were identified as hotspots for management. Projections under different scenarios showed that some unsustainable sites could be reversed to sustainable sites through improvements in land use policies. The proposed approach could provide essential tools for the formulation of mangrove conservation and restoration strategies adapted to climate change.","2023-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:43","2024-01-19 10:23:43","","116554","","","325","","Journal of Environmental Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Land use policies; Mangrove habitat; Sustainable mangrove management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, accurate spatial modeling of soil organic matter (SOM) in areas with high vegetation coverage, typically represented by agroecosystems, remains a challenge for field-scale estimation using remote sensing. To date, studies have focused on using single-period or multi-temporal vegetation information to characterize SOM. Thus, the relationship between SOM content and time-series vegetation biomass has not yet been fully explored. In addition, most studies have ignored the effects of critical soil properties and human activities (e.g., soil salinization, soil particle size fractions, history of land-use changes) on SOM. By integrating information on vegetation, soil, and human activities, we propose a novel framework for assessing SOM in cotton fields of artificial oases in northwest China, where returned straw is one of the primary sources of SOM coming from vegetation. We developed an Annual Maximum Biomass Accumulation Index (AMBAI) using time-series Landsat images from 1990 to 2019. Subsequently, we quantified the information of the planting years (PY) of cropland using spectral index threshold and incorporated proximal sensing data (soil hyperspectral and apparent conductivity data) and soil particle size fractions to establish a predictive model of SOM using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The results revealed that AMBAI had the highest correlation coefficient (r) with SOM (0.76, P < 0.01). AMBAI, soil hyperspectral data, and PY were the most relevant predictors for estimating SOM. The CNN model integrating vegetation, soil, and human activity information performed best, with coefficient of determination (R2), relative analysis error (RPD), and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.83, 2.38 and 1.38 g kg−1, respectively.

To support global action on sustainable development and healthy ageing, we investigated the spatiotemporal heterogeneity toward associations between national population ageing (the share of the population aged 65 and older) and various socioeconomic and environmental factors for 189 countries and territories from 2001 to 2020. We adopted Bayesian Spatiotemporally Varying Coefficients (STVC) model to fit the spatial and temporal heterogeneous associations among variables. The concept of variance partitioning was innovatively integrated into Bayesian STVC modeling to propose a spatiotemporal variance partitioning index (STVPI) for identifying the explainable percentage of influencing factors considering their spatiotemporal heterogeneous impacts. The results showed that global ageing had increased rapidly over the past 20 years, especially after 2009, and exhibited a clear geospatial agglomeration, with Europe and Africa possessing the highest and lowest regional ageing levels. The total explainable percentages of socioeconomic and environmental factors for global ageing were 61.85% [95% credible intervals (CIs): 58.57%–64.9%] and 37.40% (95% CIs: 34.38%–40.65%), respectively. Specifically, the cumulative explainable percentage of the five factors, male-to-female ratio, gross national income (GNI), particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and temperature, exceeded 90%. Over time, the annual impacts of education, male-to-female ratio, and physicians were increasing year by year; in contrast, the annual impacts of hospital beds, GNI, NDVI, PM2.5, and precipitation showed downward trends. Geospatially, the country-scale impacts of all factors showed substantial geographical disparities globally but significant clusters regionally. According to country subgroups (not-ageing, ageing, aged, and hyper-aged society), sex ratio, national income, air quality, greenness, and climate consistently played essential roles across the subgroups of four ageing stages. Our findings focusing on spatiotemporal disparities toward ageing and its influencing factors are expected to inform the formation of differentiated policies tailored for different national contexts in response to global ageing. The STVC-based STVPI is promising to be used in broader natural and social sciences to determine the relative importance of potential influencing factors within spatiotemporal dimensions to real-world phenomena.","2022-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:44","2024-01-19 10:23:44","","133781","","","373","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bayesian STVC model; Global ageing; Socioeconomic and environment; Space-time relative importance of factors; Spatiotemporal nonstationarity; Spatiotemporal variance partitioning index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

China successfully eliminated extreme poverty at the end of 2020, and thus is a good example to investigate what causes poverty and how it is eradicated.

GIS techniques were used to prepare the various maps to understand the population growth, road network, ward boundaries etc. The study showed that the total quantity of waste generated in the Shivamogga city can be estimated as 210 tons per day (TPD), including 34 TPD of silt waste from drainage. Through the sampling studies conducted on field, it has been estimated that households and commercial establishments are the major waste generators in the city, with households generate about 55% of waste generated in the city and commercial establishments generate about 11% of the waste adding up to 66% of the total waste generated. This paper also provides recommendations on building adaptable solutions for the existing problems in Shivamogga.","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:44","2024-01-19 10:23:44","","18-26","","3","1","","Waste Management Bulletin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GIS; Municipal solid waste; Shivamogga; Waste characterisation; Waste generation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, an efficient and accurate fine-grained segmentation method is crucial for monitoring the Benggang areas. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based automatic segmentation method for Benggang by integrating high-resolution Digital Orthophoto Map (DOM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. The DSM data is used to extract slope maps, aiming to capture primary morphological features. The proposed method consists of a dual-stream convolutional encoder-decoder network in which multiple cascaded convolutional layers and a skip connection scheme are used to extract morphological and visual features of the Benggang areas. The rich discriminative information in the DOM and slope data is fused by a channel exchanging mechanism that dynamically exchanges the most discriminative features from either the DOM or DSM stream according to their importance at the channel level. Evaluation experiments were conducted on a challenging dataset collected from Guangdong Province, China, and the results show that the proposed channel exchanging network based deep fusion method achieves 84.62% IoU in Benggang segmentation, outperforming several existing unimodal or multimodal baselines. The proposed multimodal segmentation method greatly improves the efficiency of large-scale discovery of Benggang, and thus is important for the management and restoration of Benggang in southern and southeastern China, as well as the monitoring of other similar erosional landscapes.","2023-11-16","2024-01-19 10:23:44","2024-01-19 10:23:44","","","","","","","International Soil and Water Conservation Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Benggang segmentation; Channel exchanging; Deep fusion; DOM; DSM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sustainable agri-food production technologies have been reliable in mitigating poverty caused by high demands for food. Recently, the applications of agri-food system technologies have been meaningfully changing the worldwide scene due to both external strengths and internal forces. Digital agriculture (DA) is a pioneering technology helping to meet the growing global demand for sustainable food production. Integrating different sub-branches of DA technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics into agriculture practices to reduce waste, optimize farming inputs and enhance crop production. This can help shift from tedious operations to continuously automated processes, resulting in increasing agricultural production by enabling the traceability of products and processes. The application of DA provides agri-food producers with accurate and real-time observations regarding different features influencing their productivity, such as plant health, soil quality, weather conditions, and pest and disease pressure. Analyzing the results achieved by DA can help agricultural producers and scholars make better decisions to increase yields, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and manage resources. The core focus of the current work is to clarify the benefits of some sub-branches of DA in increasing agricultural production efficiency, discuss the challenges of practical DA in the field, and highlight the future perspectives of DA.

Machine learning approaches, which excel at detecting potential complex nonlinear relationships, provide opportunities to estimate Chla accurately for optically complex waters. However, the uncertainties in atmospheric correction (AC) may be amplified in different Chla algorithms. Here, we aim to select one state-of-the-art algorithm or establish a new algorithm based on machine learning approaches that less sensitive to AC uncertainties. Firstly, nine state-of-the-art empirical, semianalytical, and optical water types (OWT) classification-based Chla algorithms were implemented. These existing algorithms showed good performance by using in situ database, however, failed in actual OLCI applications due to their sensitivity to AC uncertainties. Thus, four popular machine learning approaches (random forest regression (RFR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), deep neural network (DNN), and support vector regression (SVR)) were then employed. Among them, the “RFR-Chla” model performed the best and showed less sensitivity to AC uncertainties. Finally, the Chla spatiotemporal variations in 163 major lakes across eastern China were mapped from OLCI between May 2016 and April 2020 using the proposed RFR-Chla model. Generally, the lakes in eastern China are severely eutrophic, with an average Chla concentration of 33.39 ± 6.95 μg/L. Spatially, Chla in the south of eastern China was significantly higher than those in northern lakes. Seasonally, Chla was high in the summer and autumn and low in the spring and winter.

Before applying a calibrated spectral predictive model to acquire soil information, either independent validation or k-fold cross validation is used to evaluate model performance. However, there is no consensus on which validation strategy is more suitable and robust when evaluating model performance for the studies in different scales. The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the model performance of two validation strategies coupling different calibration sizes (a ratio of calibration to validation of 2:1, 4:1 and 9:1) and calibration sampling strategies (random sampling (RS), rank, Kennard-Stone (KS), rank-Kennard-Stone (RKS) and conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS)) across scales. A total of 17,272 vis–NIR spectra of mineral soils from LUCAS data (continental scale) and their soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay contents were used in this study, and the dataset was further split into national (2761 samples in France) and five regional datasets (110 to 248 samples from five French administrative regions). To eliminate the effect of changing validation set on the model performance, a consistent test set (20% of total samples at each scale) was split to evaluate all the combinations involved in two validation strategies. The Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of the cubist model were stable for both SOC and clay for different calibration sizes, calibration sampling and validation strategies for a large calibration size (>1400) at the national and continental scales. A larger calibration size can potentially improve model performance for a small dataset (<300) at the regional scale, and a wider calibration range would result in better model performance. No silver bullet was found among the different calibration sampling strategies at the regional scale. For five French regions (small data set), we found a high variation (95th percentile minus the 5th percentile) in the CCC among the models built from 50 repeated RS (0.10–0.44 for SOC, 0.16–0.52 for clay) and cLHS (0.08–0.40 for SOC, 0.12–0.36 for clay). This finding indicates that a one-time RS or cLHS for selecting the calibration set has high uncertainty in model evaluation for a small dataset and therefore should be used with caution. Therefore, we suggest the following: (1) for a large data set (thousands), either one-time random sampling for independent validation or k-fold cross validation would be appropriate; (2) for a small data set (dozens to hundreds), k-fold cross validation and/or repeated random sampling for independent validation would be more robust for spectral predictive model evaluation.","2021-10-15","2024-01-19 10:23:44","2024-01-19 10:23:44","","115159","","","400","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration sampling; Clay; Model robustness; Proximal soil sensing; Soil organic carbon; Vis–NIR spectra","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the interference from abiotic sounds and the lack of a comprehensive audio library have impeded effective evaluation. This study investigated the application of underwater soundscapes as a remote-sensing method to detect biological and anthropogenic activities. Using techniques including the visualization of long-duration recordings, source separation, and clustering, soundscapes were separated into sounds of anthropogenic and biological sources. Our results revealed the dynamics of biological sounds among coral reefs off Sesoko Island, Okinawa, Japan. Biological sounds were much more prominent in shallow-water reefs than in upper-mesophotic reefs, but their spectral features and compositions differed. The shallow-water reefs were dominated by broadband sounds of crustaceans and low-frequency transient fish calls, whereas the upper-mesophotic reefs were characterized by a diverse array of fish choruses and transient sounds. We also discovered that shipping noise heavily interfered with the soundscapes from the upper-mesophotic reefs and represented an invisible threat to life in the low-light habitat. The applied techniques of soundscape information retrieval revealed the distinct ecological status of coral reefs and the behavior change of sound-producing organisms in high temporal resolution. Implementation of soundscape monitoring can generate ecological information on habitat quality, reef biodiversity, human activities, and their interactions.

It is imperative to explore the potential changes in future water resources and water-related hazards at the regional scale under global warming and local socioeconomic development, while a scientific assessment of future hydrological risks requires reasonable projection of future climate, land use and vegetation changes. In order to improve the traditional statistical downscaling method, this study combines the machine learning and quantile mapping methods to project future climate under four shared socio-economic pathway-representative concentration pathways (SSP-RCP) of the CMIP6. Future land use is projected jointly with the future climate by the CA-Markov model, and the vegetation dynamics are simulated by the Biome-BGC model. Then we employ a physically-based distributed hydrological model to simulate the future hydrological changes in the Upper Chao Phraya basin under the interaction among climate and land use changes and the vegetation dynamics. The results show that under the joint impact of climate and land-use changes, the study area may face increasing water scarcity and more frequent floods and droughts in the future. Water scarcity will reach the worst in the mid-21st century (water resources per capita decrease 34.2% compared to the 2010 s). By the end-21st century, the 100-year historical flood and drought in the study basin will increase by 1.63 times and 0.59 times, respectively, under the SSP126 scenario (the most sustainable pathway), and by 4.55 times and 1.56 times under the SSP370 scenario (the most pessimistic rocky-road pathway). Results demonstrate that climate change is the major cause for more frequent floods and droughts in the future, while afforestation or more sustainable land use management will mitigate the adverse effects of climate change to some extent.

However, sufficient data on personal exposure to air pollution is still rare or unavailable in developing countries such as Iraq. Thus, this paper investigated the personal exposure and inhalation doses of PM1 and PM2.5 in Al-Hillah city, Iraq, for four common motorized transportation modes, namely open windows car, closed window car, bus, and motorbike. A portable monitoring device was used to collect the data during morning and afternoon hours in two main streets in the city. A t-test examination of the obtained results showed that the mean exposure concentration for both PM2.5 and PM1 were significantly different in the two streets form most of the transportation modes. The difference in the means of the measured PM1 and PM2.5 in the morning and afternoon trips were statistically significant for all the transportation modes except for bus in 60 street. This highlights the special and temporal variation of air pollution in the city. This is largely due the deteriorated infrastructure and lack of control policies in the city. Overall, PM2.5 and PM1 measured exposure concentrations were higher in the morning trips than in the afternoon ones. Regardless of the time or place of measurements, closed windows cars always had the lowest exposure concentrations to PM1 and PM2.5. The alarming observation in this study was the high levels of PM1 and PM2.5 that exceeded the recommended WHO limits, and were higher than the reported concentrations in the world bank database.

This work envisages forest identification as a few-shot semantic segmentation task to achieve generalization across different geographical regions. The proposed few-shot segmentation approach incorporates a texture attention module in the prototypical network to highlight the texture features of the forest. Indeed, the forest exhibits a characteristic texture different from other classes, such as road, water, etc. In this work, the proposed approach is trained for identifying tropical forests of South Asia and adapted to determine the temperate forest of Central Europe with the help of a few (one image for 1-shot) manually annotated support images of the temperate forest. An IoU of 0.62 for forest class (1-way 1-shot) was obtained using the proposed method, which is significantly higher (0.46 for PANet) than the existing few-shot semantic segmentation approach. Besides, the experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of the texture attention module in the existing prototypical few-shot segmentation methods (PFENet and ASGNet) results in a more accurate forest identification. These results indicate that the proposed approach can generalize across geographical regions for forest identification, creating an opportunity to develop a global forest cover identification tool.","2023-06-14","2024-01-19 10:23:44","2024-01-19 10:23:44","","126201","","","538","","Neurocomputing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cross-geography generalization; Few shot learning; Forest identification; Semantic segmentation; Sustainable development goals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we proposed an approach that estimates the poverty rate at different spatial scales with a consistent standard within a country. We first trained the model based on household survey data and publicly available remote sensing data to derive a wealth index map, and then we developed the relationship between the wealth index and the poverty rate at country-level. The relationship finally was applied to estimate the multi-spatial scale poverty rates in the study area. We made validation between the estimated and statistical province-level poverty rates using relative error and R-Square. A case study was carried out in Mozambique. The results showed that the proposed model has a good ability to estimate poverty rate with an overall accuracy of 85.21%, as well as an R-Square of 0.94. There was a huge gap within Mozambique, with the Northern Provinces holding high poverty rates and the Southern Provinces holding low poverty rates. The district-level poverty rate map might reflect the negative impact of climate disasters, as well as the positive influence of economic and trade exchange.

Resilient forests are at a lower risk of high-intensity wildfires, drought, insects, and other disturbances and provide a wide range of benefits to ecosystems and communities. However, insufficient funding limits implementation of critically needed management. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-benefit framework that leverages the diverse benefits of forest management to engage a suite of stakeholders in sharing project costs. We take a three-pronged approach to develop our conceptual model: examining existing frameworks for environmental project implementation, conducting a literature review of forest management benefits, and evaluating case studies. Through our framework, we describe the steps to engage partners, starting by identifying benefits that could accrue to potential public and private beneficiaries, and moving through an iterative and collaborative process of valuing benefits, which can accrue over different spatial and temporal scales, in close consultation with potential beneficiaries themselves. The aim of this approach is to stack funding streams associated with each valued benefit to fully fund a given forest management project. The multi-benefit framework has the potential to unlock new sources of funding to meet the exceptional challenges of climate and wildfire disturbances. We apply the framework to dry forests of the Western U.S., but opportunities exist for expanding and modifying this approach to any geography or ecosystem where management provides multiple benefits.","2023-10-15","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","118270","","","344","","Journal of Environmental Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Forest management; Innovative funding framework; Multi-benefit approach; Natural resource management; Wildfire risk reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a response, international environmental agreements and related programs require information about tropical forested landscapes. Despite the increasing quantity and quality of remote sensing-based data, the effective monitoring of forests in the tropics still faces operational challenges: (a) applicability at local levels, with lack of reference or cloud-free information; (b) overcoming geographical, ecological, or biophysical variability; (c): stratification, distinguishing forest categories related to functionality and disturbance history. We conducted an extensive ground verification campaign through 36 landscapes in 9 regions of Zambia, Ecuador and Philippines, which constitute a gradient of pantropical deforestation contexts or forest transitions. We collected over 16,000 ground control points and digitized over 18,000 ha with details on land use and forest disturbance history. We trained a random forest algorithm and generated high-resolution (30 m) binary forest maps covering ~15 Mha, building on 39 optical (Landsat-8), radar (Sentinel-1) and elevation bands, indices and textures. We validated the quality of the outputs across the studied deforestation gradient and compared them to (a): 3 national land cover maps used for international reporting, (b): 4 global forest datasets (Global Forest Change, Copernicus Land Cover, JAXA and TanDEM-X Forest/Non-Forest). Our method generated highly accurate (92%) forest maps for the studied regions when compared to the global datasets, which generally overestimated forest cover. We achieved accuracies similar to the national maps, following a standardized method for all countries. The difficulties in delineating forest increased in more advanced stages of deforestation, with recurring struggles to distinguish non-forest tree-based systems (e.g. perennials, palms, or agroforestry), shrublands and grasslands. Regrowth forests were repeatedly misclassified across contexts, countries and datasets, in contrast to reference or degraded forests. Our results highlight the importance of in situ verification as accompanying method to establish efficient forest monitoring systems, especially in areas with higher rates of forest cover change and in tropical regions of advanced deforestation or early reforestation stages. These are precisely the areas where current REDD+ or Forest Landscape Restoration initiatives take place.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","112997","","","274","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Forest landscape restoration; Forest mapping; Forest monitoring; Landsat 8; Redd+; Sentinel 1; Supervised classification; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropical deforestation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, assessing this parameter is also the most challenging tasks in the agronomic field. The objective of this work was to predict the spatial distribution of soil depth from space techniques (remote sensing, RS) and machine learning. A total of 292 sites were allocated (based on the toposequence approach) and drilled (0–2 m depth) at three different locations in Brazil. Based on these, in-situ traditional depth maps (denominated field-map) were elaborated for validation. Afterwards, we created a strategy to achieve these different depths by RS (RS) approach. Landsat 8 OLI bands, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and emissivity in dry and rainy seasons as well as terrain attributes were applied to predict soil depth. For this purpose, the most important covariates were selected using Recursive Feature Selection (RFE) based on Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Afterwards, the application of RF and SVM by selected covariates were compared based on tenfold cross validation for each location. The best model was selected based on R2, RMSE and MAE, accuracy and bootstrapping approach and uncertainties. Terrain attributes were important to discriminate soil depth. Although, LST and NDVI also presented important contribution to this task. Different seasons implies on water and plant dynamics in deep and shallow soils. This impacted on NDVI and LST as detected by RS. Thus, the method brings more variables to infer soil depth. The RF model performed better than SVM to predict soil depth with an average of 0.77 R2.

Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the UHI effect. In this context, the implementation of Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) can partially reduce UHI intensity, promoting a resilient urban environment and contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation. In order to achieve this result, there is a need to systematically integrate UGI into urban planning and legislation, but this process is subject to the availability of widely applicable, easily accessible and quantitative evidence. To offer a big picture of urban heat intensity and opportunities to mitigate high temperatures, we developed a model that reports the Ecosystem Service (ES) of microclimate regulation of UGI in 601 European cities. The model simulates the temperature difference between a baseline and a no-vegetation scenario, extrapolating the role of UGI in mitigating UHI in different urban contexts. Finally, a practical, quantitative indicator that can be applied by policymakers and city administrations has been elaborated, allowing to estimate the amount of urban vegetation that is needed to cool summer temperatures by a certain degree. UGI is found to cool European cities by 1.07 °C on average, and up to 2.9 °C, but in order to achieve a 1 °C drop in urban temperatures, a tree cover of at least 16% is required. The microclimate regulation ES is mostly dependent on the amount of vegetation inside a city and by transpiration and canopy evaporation. Furthermore, in almost 40% of the countries, more than half of the residing population does not benefit from the microclimate regulation service provided by urban vegetation. Widespread implementation of UGI, in particular in arid regions and cities with insufficient tree cover, is key to ensure healthy urban living conditions for citizens.","2022-02-01","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","103564","","","77","","Sustainable Cities and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecosystem services; Microclimate regulation; Nature-based solutions; Urban green infrastructure; Urban heat island","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, selecting the best modeling technique for a given landscape has been a challenge for mapping soil property. Typically, the conventional variable set (such as soil factors, climatic factors, terrain factors, and organism factors) is widely used to predict soil pH. However, certain covariates are difficult to obtain for some regions with poor data. Additionally, the effectiveness of vegetation indices (such as normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and phenological variables that can monitor vegetation growth dynamics based on satellite remote sensing for soil pH mapping are largely unclear. Accordingly, this study aimed to set up five environmental variable sets, such as NDVI, phenological variables, conventional variable set, conventional variable set + NDVI (C + N), and conventional variable set + phenological variables (C + P). The random forest (RF) model and convolutional neural network (CNN) model were used to compare the performance of these five environmental variable sets for spatial prediction for topsoil pH. In total, 4332 soil samples were applied and randomly divided into calibration (80%) and validation sets (20%) in this study. The model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that among the five environmental variable sets, the conventional variable set was the best to predict soil pH (R2 = 0.85, RMSE = 0.41). Further, among the remote sensing variables, the phenological variables outperformed NDVI, explaining up to 67% of the variation in topsoil pH. The RF model could achieved higher accuracy than the CNN model regardless of the variables selected. Moreover, the conventional variable set could predict topsoil pH, and exhibited the potential of phenological variables. The results indicated when the conventional variable set was difficult to obtain or was missing, phenological variables can be used to predict soil properties and perform digital mapping instead of the conventional variable set.","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","102290","","","78","","Ecological Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conventional variable set; Convolutional neural network; Digital soil mapping; Random forest; Remote sensing; Topsoil pH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that topography had a negative effect on agricultural intensification during 1990–2010 and on urbanization during 1990–2000, but it had a positive effect on ecological restoration during 2000–2015 at the regional scale. Moreover, although there was no significant impact from economic development on any type of LCCs at the regional scale, its important influence could be seen in some of the township categories. Therefore, the path and scale dependence of driving forces is an important consideration in landscape planning and management to accommodate local conditions and fine-tuned analysis as decision-making supports.","2020-10-15","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","139622","","","739","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cluster analysis; Land cover change; Loess Plateau; Mixed-effects model; Scale effects; Structural equation modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Landsat data can be used to trace water quality changes over approximately 40 years. However, chlorophyll-a (Chla) estimation, which characterizes the trophic status, has not been thoroughly explored (especially in turbid water using wide bandwidth Landsat) due to the interference of suspended particulate matter (SPM) to Chla. In this study, we used Landsat TM/OLI for turbid water Chla inversion and to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of Chla in Lake Taihu for 38 years and its influencing factors. An optical classification algorithm based on Rrs(green)/Rrs(red) was used to exclude highly turbid waters dominated by SPM; Chla was estimated only in waters with low SPM. We constructed an exponential estimation model based on Rrs(NIR)/Rrs(red), and verified the accuracy of the model using the measured Chla synchronized with satellite data. The model was applied to Landsat images to calculate the Chla concentration in Lake Taihu during 1984–2021, and its spatiotemporal distribution patterns were further analyzed. Spatially, the Chla concentrations in the western and northern regions of Lake Taihu were higher than those in other regions, probably because these areas are estuaries with large exogenous pollutant discharge and more nutrients are imported from exogenous sources. Chla showed an overall significant upward trend from 1984 to 2021 probably because of temperature rise, wind speed reduction, and nutrient increase. The results of the spatial and temporal variation of Chla and the influencing factors in this study provide supporting data for eutrophication monitoring and management in Lake Taihu. The proposed Chla estimation method can be extended to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of eutrophication in other inland waters with similar optical properties.","2023-05-15","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","162168","","","873","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chlorophyll-a; Lake Taihu; Landsat; Spatiotemporal variation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, monitoring large areas presents significant challenges due to strong spatial and temporal variability. Environmental covariates show promise in predicting salinity over large areas provided a reasonable relationship is developed with field measured salinity at few points. While simple regression-based approaches to complex data mining methods have been used in the prediction, a comprehensive comparison of their performances has not been explored, leading to uncertainty in which algorithms to select. This study compares thirteen popularly and non-popularly used algorithms and their performances following four criteria in predicting soil salinity from environmental covariates from Kuqa Oasis from Xinjiang, China. The environmental covariates used for the prediction include principal components of Landsat satellite images at multiple spectral bands, climate factors (referring to land surface temperature), vegetation indices, salinity and soil-related indices, soil moisture indices, DEM derived indices, land use, landform and soil type and categorized them under parameter categories of the SCORPAN (S, soils; C, climate; O, organisms, biotic factor; R, relief; P, parent material; A, age; and N, space) model. The predictive relationships were developed using the algorithms including some previously used ones such as Multiple Linear regression (MLR), Multi-Layer Perceptron-Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), M5 Model Tree (M5), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) and some that have not previously been used in predicting salinity such as Alternating Model Tree (ATM), Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR), Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), Least Median Squared Linear Regression (LMSLR), and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree). Here, 5-fold cross-validation and an independent dataset (30% overall samples) at three depths, 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm, were used for parameter optimization and evaluating the performance of algorithms. The performances of these algorithms were compared against multiple criteria, including the parameterization, error level/fitting accuracy (determination coefficient, R2; root mean squared error, RMSE), stability (based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, R; mean absolute percent error, MAPE; root mean squared error, RMSE; Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, LCCC) and computational efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the result showed that CSRI is most important parameter for the prediction of soil salinity at the 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm depths, whereas for the 30–50 cm depth interval, VD was the most important predictor. For depths of 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm and 30–50 cm across all models, the model R2 values ranged from 0.60 to 0.74, 0.15 to 0.31, and 0.30 to 0.47, and the RMSE values ranged from 18.87 to 23.49 dS m−1, 9.94 to 13.48 dS m−1 and 3.79 to 7.11 dS m−1. The optimal algorithms at three depths of 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm and 30–50 cm are RF, M5 and GRBF with considering accuracy and stability. After a comprehensive assessment of algorithm performance, we recommend RF for mapping salinity in an arid environment such as that of Xinjiang and elsewhere globally. However, there is no algorithm that can perform ideally for all datasets. Therefore, we suggest that the algorithm should be carefully chosen according to the purposes of the study.","2020-04-15","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","114211","","","365","","Geoderma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Algorithms; Environmental covariates; Predictive mapping; Random forest; Soil salinization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study applied the ES matrix approach and spatial panel models to quantify the supply–demand balance of ESs in the southwest karst region and to identify their spatial determinants and spillover effects. The overall patterns for landscape metrics between 1980 and 2015 remained relatively stable, while landscape fragmentation and population growth weakened the ES supply capacity but increased the demand, which caused an imbalance (i.e. the demand exceeded the supply), particularly in the surrounding areas of the urban agglomerations. Population density and individual landscape metrics were significantly associated with ES balance (p < 0.01) and were identified as the dominant spatial determinants. Additionally, the spillover effects of determinants also influenced ES balance patterns, which should be considered in integrated landscape planning and ecosystem management to coordinate collaborations from local and adjacent regions to mitigate ES imbalance. Excessive reclamation and urbanisation temporarily improved grain provision and economic profits, respectively, but caused an imbalance in ESs and threatened ecological security. Additionally, excessive conservation practices ignored economic costs and the livelihood of residents, which threatened food security and exacerbated poverty. Therefore, a balance between the contrasting targets should be maintained through the lens of ES balance to reconcile ecosystem conservation and socioeconomic development. This study provides a complete and feasible perspective to examine and optimise human interventions, with the aim of achieving win-win goals.","2022-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","106472","","","174","","Ecological Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Landscape metrics; Spatial determinants; Spillover effect; Supply and demand","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the planetary spatial footprint of land degradation processes on arable lands, which can be considered a major component of global agricultural systems, is still insufficiently well understood. This study analyzes the land degradation footprint on global arable lands, using complex geospatial data on certain major degradation processes, i.e. aridity, soil erosion, vegetation decline, soil salinization and soil organic carbon decline. By applying geostatistical techniques that are representative for identifying the incidence of the five land degradation processes in global arable lands, results showed that aridity is by far the largest singular pressure for these agricultural systems, affecting ~40% of the arable lands' area, which cover approximately 14 million km2 globally. It was found that soil erosion is another major degradation process, the unilateral impact of which affects ~20% of global arable systems. The results also showed that the two degradation processes simultaneously affect an additional ~7% of global arable lands, which makes this synergy the most common form of multiple pressure of land degradative conditions across the world's arable areas. The absolute statistical data showed that India, the United States, China, Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Australia are the most vulnerable countries in the world to the various pathways of arable land degradation. Also, in terms of percentages, statistical observations showed that African countries are the most heavily affected by arable system degradation. This study's findings can be useful for prioritizing agricultural management actions that can mitigate the negative effects of the two degradation processes or of others that currently affect many arable systems across the planet.","2021-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","110697","","","194","","Environmental Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Arable lands; Global impact; Incidence; Land degradation processes; Spatial analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past two decades, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has posed huge potential for urban monitoring with its all-weather and all-day imaging capability over rainy and cloudy regions around the world. Unfortunately, some critical challenges associated with UIS identification from data have been identified due to the high diversity of UIS and the different SAR imaging mechanisms from optical remote sensing. To address the challenges, this study proposed a new method of polarimetric scattering mixture analysis (PSMA) by modeling the diverse scattering mechanisms of various UIS categories. C- and L-band full-polarization SAR data in four typical urban areas from central, eastern, and southern China, were employed to evaluate the performance of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an overall accuracy (OA) exceeding 96 % across all study cases. Compared with traditional methods, PSMA significantly reduces land cover confusion and enhances the producer's (PA) and user's accuracy (UA) for UIS, particularly for “road”, by up to 13.4 % and 9.5 %, respectively. Non-impervious surfaces such as “soil” and “vegetation” witness a notable increase in PA and UA by up to 10 % and 20.5 %, respectively. These promising results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed method for accurate urban monitoring and understanding land cover scattering confusion over complex urban environments.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","103541","","","124","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scattering mixture; Synthetic aperture radar; Urban impervious surface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper revisits the issue with machine learning techniques and novel disaggregate data to model these relationships heterogeneously across economic indicators. Results suggest that development gradually improves the efficiency of consuming the earth's nonrenewable resources, but increased efficiency alone is not sufficient to offset growth in scale. Development shifts reliance on one nonrenewable source to another, and on average we find successive inverted U-shapes in deforestation, air pollution and carbon intensities, followed by a J-shape in per capita carbon output. Local economic circumstances further determine the shape, amplitude, and location of tipping points in environmental output. The general implications of the estimated dynamics are explored by extrapolating environmental output to 2030 under simplistic scenario's.

However, the traditional Cellular Automata (CA) model supposes that each cell has only one land use type at each time step, neglects the mixed structure and proportional distribution of land use units, does not take into account its quantitative continuous dynamic change, and lacks the exploration of land use quantity structure and spatial pattern optimization. This study employed a novel mixed-cell cellular automata (MCCA) approach, coupled with the system dynamics (SD) model to predict the spatiotemporal pattern of land use under the natural increase scenario (NIS), economic development scenario (EDS) and ecological protection scenario (EPS) in Xi’an, China, in 2030. The equivalent coefficient method was utilized to investigate the heterogeneity distribution and sensitivity of ESV. The results demonstrated that SD-MCCA exhibited remarkable prediction accuracy and robustness. The main changes in land use in 2000–2015 were due to urban expansion, the conversion of arable land into construction land, and the conversion between grassland and arable land. The total ESV increased from 19554.36×106 CNY in 2000 to 19618.39×106 CNY under the EPS in 2030, and the contribution of climate regulation and hydrological regulation to ESV was the highest. Spatial heterogeneity of ESV revealed a certain regularity, and the high value region was chiefly concentrated in woodland and grassland with favorable ecological conditions. Land use variations under NIS and EPS improved ESV, while the ESV had a negative response to land use transformations under the EDS. This research provides a new way to identify the relationship between future land utilization scenarios and ESV, which is of great significance for the management of land resources and formulation of ecological compensation standards.","2023-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","110009","","","147","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecosystem service value; MCCA; Scenario prediction; SD; Sensitivity analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research activity provides for the involvement of territories belonging to the inner areas of Sicily, especially Calatino one, in which the SIMBIOSI Consortium operates an AD plant fed with agricultural by-products from other close agro-industrial companies. The aim of the study was to map and to quantify the actual spatial distribution of GR in watercourses embankments through Remote Sensing (RS) techniques applied in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. In this regard, a method based on the automatic supervised classification, was applied on three different combinations of spectral bands (True Color Image – TCI; Near-Infrared, Green and Blue – NGB; Vegetation Red Edge – VRE) of Sentinel-2 satellite images related to the summer season (11th August 2019), with the aim of identifying the most suitable classification to map the GR. The results showed that the VRE composition is the most accurate combination of spectral bands for the identification of GR, followed by the NGB image. The worst performance was obtained by using the TCI combination. A further elaboration was carried out combining the three classified images, in order to obtain a more accurate localization and quantification of GR. The final thematic map allowed to correctly classify GR for the 46 % of the cases, with an overall accuracy of 85.02 % and a high Kappa Coefficient of Agreement value equal to 0.81. Finally, the surface covered by GR in the study area (computed in the GIS environment) was about 2 km2 and the estimated GR biomass, available for the biomethane production, obtainable from watercourses embankments maintenance interventions would amount to about 11,780 tons year−1. The study could contribute to the development of a watercourses maintenance plan with the aim to reduce the risk of streams flooding in valley areas and at intersections with infrastructure works. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can be used by stakeholders in marginal areas, for the watercourses management, offsetting its costs through the energy use of the collected biomass.","2022-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","109548","","","144","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biochemical methane potential; Hydraulic risk; Invasive species; L.; Remote sensing; Riparian vegetation management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have trained a novel neural network architecture to produced 5 meter resolution land use maps for a global stratified sample of 200 cities. The sample includes all world regions, 78 countries, and a range of population sizes. The model architecture is roughly 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than similar architectures such as UNet (Ronneberger, Fischer, & Brox, 2015) and DeeplabV3+ (Chen, Zhu, Papandreou, Schroff, & Adam, 2018), significantly lowering the cost and computational requirements to produce maps. We are in the process of generating land use maps for all 4,000 + cities and metropolitan areas in the world with populations exceeding 100,000. The resulting product will be the first, regularly updated, freely available, global intra-urban land use maps at 5 meter resolution. We present a 4-tier land use taxonomy which at its root distinguishes open-space from built-up area. At the second tier, it subdivides the built-up category into nonresidential and residential areas. The third tier distinguishes formal from informal residential land use, and the fourth tier further subdivides formal and informal residential land uses into more detailed categories. Accuracy scores at tier-1 and tier-2 were 86% and 79% respectively. Tiers 3 and 4 had an accuracy scores of 75% and 71% respectively.

A socio-cyber-physical system (SCPS) concept can help this analysis, but little experience exists with its operationalisation and application, and its integration with the Responsible Research and Innovation approach. OBJECTIVE To address this gap, this paper has a twofold purpose: a) operationalise the SCPS concept within an integrated assessment framework adaptable to multiple levels of analysis, contexts, and purposes (e.g. ex-ante, ongoing, ex post evaluation) to shed light on impacts of digitalisation in relation to SCPS entities, relationships, and activities; b) apply the designed framework in 21 multi-stakeholder platforms (Living Labs), which were established to explore needs and expectations in specific subjects relevant for European agriculture, forestry and rural areas. METHODS Impacts were assessed through interviews (158 respondents), focus groups (378 participants), online surveys (273 respondents), and other secondary data. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that the SCPS framework enables elucidating relationships between digital and broader sustainable development goals and needs, and can sharpen earlier assessments, going beyond a pessimistic or optimistic dichotomy associated to digitalisation by specifying effects and trade-offs in terms of enabling, disenabling, boosting and depleting impacts of digital agriculture. However, the framework being comprehensive and open to emerging socio-cyber-physical interactions, makes that Livings Labs doing participatory impact assessments struggled with the complexity and multiple dimensions of the topic. SIGNIFICANCE The paper provides both conceptual and operational knowledge to set up impact evaluations of responsible digitalisation in agriculture and outline concepts that can help anticipating the consequences and trade-offs.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:45","2024-01-19 10:23:45","","103533","","","203","","Agricultural Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agricultural multifunctionality; Digital agriculture; Digital transformation; Impact assessment; On-farm diversification; Responsible research and innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study systematically investigates the consistency and uncertainty of eight ET products over China for the period from 2003 to 2014. Temporal and spatial pairwise correlation analysis indicates that the ET products are largely consistent with each other, among which the ET estimates from GLEAM and EB-ET presenting highest spatial consistency with each other (R2 = 0.91). Compared to the ground-based observations from the flux network, the centered root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) for each of the eight products is found lower than 30 mm/month, according to which CR and PMLv2 outperform the others. The ET products however show considerable difference in the estimated mean annual ET averaged over China (from 378 mm/a to 528 mm/a). Uncertainty assessment based on the extended collocation method (ECM) suggests the uncertainties in ET estimates are more evident in the arid region than in the humid region. It also indicates that model averaging (like that in generating the GLASS ET product) could substantially reduce the uncertainties.

Despite the rapid decline in scleractinian coral habitats in South China, they are among the least concerning in global coral vulnerability maps. This study developed a rapid assessment approach that combines vulnerability components and species distribution models to map coral vulnerability within a large region based on limited data. The approach contained three aspects including, exposure, habitat suitability, and coral-conservation-based adaptive capacity. The exposure assessment was based on seven indicators, and the habitat suitability was mapped using Maximum Entropy and Random Forest models. Vulnerability of scleractinian corals in South China was spatially evaluated using the approach developed here. The results showed that the average exposure of the study region was 0.62, indicating relatively high pressure. The highest exposure occurred from the east coast of the Leizhou Peninsula to the Pearl River Estuary. Aquaculture and shipping were the most common causes of exposure. Highly suitable habitats for scleractinian corals are concentrated between 18°N–22°N. Only 21.6 % of the potential coral habitats are included in marine protected areas, indicating that there may still be large conservation gaps for scleractinian corals in China. In total, 37.7 % of the potential coral habitats were highly vulnerable, with the highest vulnerability appearing in the Guangdong Province. This study presents the first attempt to map the vulnerability of scleractinian corals along the coast of South China. The proposed approach and findings provide an essential tool and information supporting the sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems, addressing an important gap on the world's coral reef vulnerability map.","2022-11-15","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","157363","","","847","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anthropogenic stressors; Coral conservation; Coral reef; Habitat suitability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, mapping rice fields using traditional ground surveys is impractical when high cost, time and labour requirements are considered, and the availability of such detailed records is limited. Although satellite remote sensing appears to be a viable solution, conventional segmentation and classification methods with spectral bands are often unable to contrast the distinct characteristics between rice fields and other vegetation classes. To this end, we explored a novel, Google Earth Engine (GEE) based multi-index random forest (RF) classification approach to map rice fields over two decades. Landsat images from 2000 to 2020 of two Sri Lankan rice cultivation districts were extracted from GEE and a multi-index RF classification algorithm was applied to distinguish the rice fields. The results showed above 80% accuracy for both training and validation, when compared against high spatial resolution Google Earth imagery. In essence, multi-index sampling and RF together synergised the compelling classification accuracy by effectively capturing vegetation, water (ponding) and soil characteristics unique to the rice fields using a single-click approach. The maps developed in this study were further compared against the MODIS land cover type product (MCD12Q1) and the corresponding superior statistics on rice fields demonstrated the robustness of the proposed approach. Future work seeking effective index combinations is recommended, and this approach can potentially be extended to other crop analyses elsewhere.","2023-02-24","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","","","","","","Information Processing in Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Earth Engine (GEE); Image classification; Mapping rice fields; Random forest; Time series analysis; Vegetation index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the impact the urban environment has on livability, a comprehensive framework that measures and promotes livability by incorporating key principles of urban design is not yet available. In practice, indexing systems are being used as benchmarking tools to assess livability; however, little research has been conducted to determine the validity of these systems for informing future urban development and policy as well as evaluating the experience of the larger population. Recent academic research, on the other hand, offers important insights into the links between livability and elements of the urban environment. However, those works only consider specific urban issues rather than covering all key factors of urban planning to assess and improve livability. This article bridges the current gap by offering a new livability framework that combines the broad scale of point-based livability indexing systems with the precise methodologies of recent academic studies. Integrating major aspects of urban planning and the needs of diverse user groups, we present a new comprehensive and inclusive livability assessment framework based on Abraham Maslow's “Theory of Human Needs”. As empirical evidence, we include Hong Kong as a case study and identify the neglected needs (and prerequisites of these needs) of the city's residents, demonstrating our work's potential for future livability evaluations and policy modifications.

Anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) has been estimated with energy balance residual and inventory methods. However, these methods have large uncertainty and fail to further explore the spatial distribution of anthropogenic heat at large scales due to limited data availability and the complexities of human activities, urban geometry, landscapes and building thermal properties. From the heat sources of the UHIs and based on thermodynamics, this study deduces that the AHE difference between urban and surrounding rural areas can be quantified as the residual of the heat for increasing UHIs and the heat difference from natural radiation between urban and rural areas. Thus, an urban anthropogenic heat index (UAHI) is proposed to quantify the contribution of AHF to UHIs, as a proxy of AHF. The UAHI is generated using the normalized differences in urban–rural land surface temperature (LST) and albedo derived from both Landsat and MODIS data. We investigate the spatial and temporal association between the UAHI and AHF in Beijing. The results demonstrated that the average annual UAHIs in Beijing ranged from 0.168 to 0.208 and steadily improved in the last decade. The UAHI can represent detailed spatial heterogeneity and temporal variations in AHF with correlation coefficients in the range from 35% to 50%. UAHI can also identify the dynamics of AHF hotspots and the heating and cooling sources in Beijing. Overall, the UAHI is a convincing indicator of the contribution of urban anthropogenic heat to UHIs, providing a new option for quantifying AHF dynamics and improving the knowledge of urban thermal environments.","2023-04-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","103261","","","118","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) and Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) models, we first show that prediction models easily lead to very different soil maps while having at the same time quite comparable global performances. By relying afterwards on a Bayesian data fusion (BDF) approach, we emphasize the benefit of combining the output of these two prediction models in order to get a single final map that combines the major spatial features of the MLR and BME maps while at the same time improving the quality of the predictions. The advocated methodology is illustrated with the mapping of World Reference Base (WRB) soil classes over a 10,480 km2 area located in Iran. A set of 390 soil profiles allowed us to assign the WRB soil classes at these locations. In parallel, a set of potentially related covariates were computed from a 90 m resolution digital elevation model. Using MLR and BME models, predictions were obtained separately at the nodes of a 90 m resolution grid. Even if the performances of the MLR and BME models compare well, it is shown that a BDF procedure that combines both results yields improved performances, with spatial features that are a balanced combination of those found separately on the MLR and BME maps. These results emphasize the benefit of data fusion in order to improve the quality of the final map. Though the study was conducted here using MLR and BME models for predicting WRB soil classes, we believe this methodology and the corresponding findings are relevant when it comes to handle the results of spatial prediction models that are making use of distinct information sources in other soil science mapping contexts.","2019-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","104138","","","182","","CATENA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bayesian data fusion (BDF); Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME); Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR); World Reference Base (WRB)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The overall ESV of the study site was estimated at USD 46.97 × 106 in 1995, USD 36.77 × 106 in 2008, and USD 37.19 × 106 in 2020. The net ESVs of the study site declined by USD 9.78 × 106 between 1995 and 2020. The regulating service values accounted for the greatest share, accounting for over 42% in all periods, followed by provisioning and supporting service values, which accounted for over 29% and 13%, respectively, while cultural services accounted for the smallest amount of the total ESV. The ecosystem service value of food production experienced the highest increase. However, the values of the remaining 16 types of ecosystem services declined with varying degrees of reduction over the study periods. The results of this study is necessary for land-use planners and decision-makers who require site-specific information on impacts of LULCC on ecosystem service.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","e12246","","12","8","","Heliyon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecosystem service value; Google earth engine; Guna mountain; Land use land cover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The increased information content of PolSAR provides more potential inputs for machine learning and classification applications; however, polarimetric parameters tend to be simply used as input variables and the optimum parameters to efficiently separate land classes and their physical meaning has received little attention. This research application proposes a Multi-temporal Binary-Tree Classification framework (MBTC) to identify and integrate optimum scattering parameters and machine learning methods in a meaningful way. First, the optimum scattering mechanism that most effectively distinguishes pairs of land classes is derived by a Lagrange multiplier. Next, for each pair of classes, machine learning classifiers are trained by the optimum scattering power ratio and elevated by Out-Of-Bag (OOB) cross validation. Three machine learning algorithms- Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Neutral Network (NN)- are investigated. Finally, a multi-temporal binary-tree classifier is constructed, in which each pair of land classes are distinguished by the optimized machine learning algorithms. Two independent study sites in Canada are used for evaluating the MBTC framework using RADARSAT-2 observations. The London site with 6 classes is used to analyze the optimum scattering mechanisms and execute a simple classification. The Carman site with 10 classes allows for an indepdent and comprehensive assessment of the MBTC by comparing against an advanced Model-Based Decomposition (MBD). At the London site, the MBTC achieves the maximum power ratio with the optimum scattering mechanism between each pair of classes and high overall accuracy (OA) of 91% and kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.9. At the Carman site, comparisons indicate that MBTC significantly outperforms the MBD with NN and SVM classifiers but has a similar accuracy to the MBD for RF classifier with OA of 85% and Kappa of 0.82. In cases with pairs of classes that are difficult to separate, such as barley and wheat, MBTC is shown to be superior in this research application.","2019-12-15","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","111478","","","235","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Binary-tree classification; Optimum scattering mechanism; Polarimetric SAR; RADARSAT-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The complexity of causation, as well as the myriad ways that an event, or a sequence of events, creates cascading and systemic impacts, poses significant challenges to food systems research and policy alike. To identify priority food security risks and research opportunities, we asked experts from a range of fields and geographies to describe key threats to global food security over the next two decades and to suggest key research questions and gaps on this topic. Here, we present a prioritization of threats to global food security from extreme events, as well as emerging research questions that highlight the conceptual and practical challenges that exist in designing, adopting, and governing resilient food systems.

In this study, based on extensive field data and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) imagery, a random forest regression (RFR) Secchi depth (Zsd) model suitable for turbid and eutrophic waters was established. With this model, the Zsd of 86 large (> 30 km2) lakes in Eastern China was obtained from May 2016 to April 2018. Additionally, the potential for applying OLCI-derived Zsd data in the SDG 6.3.2 evaluation was assessed. Of six common atmospheric correction (AC) processors (i.e., BAC, C2RCC, POLYMER, BP, MUMM, and 6SV), 6SV often exhibited the best performance except for at 754 nm (root mean square error (RMSE) ≤ 0.0094 sr−1, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ≤ 36.27%, and mean normalized bias (MNB) ≤ 15.89%). The RFR model had higher accuracy (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.13 m, MAPE = 33.43%, and MNB = 14.55%) and was more suitable for eutrophic and turbid inland lakes across Eastern China than the other available Zsd algorithms. The average OLCI-derived Zsd of the lakes in Eastern China was 0.44 ± 0.13 m, suggesting that these lakes are extremely turbid. The average Zsd of lakes in the Eastern Plain Lake (EPL) zone (0.45 ± 0.12 m) was higher than that of the lakes in the Northeastern Plain and Mountain Lake (NPML) zone (0.40 ± 0.17 m). The majority of lakes showed higher Zsd values in summer (rainy season) than in fall and winter (dry season). A simple SDG 6.3.2 evaluation scheme was developed based on the Zsd product, and only 54.65% of the lakes (N = 47) reached the “good” level during the monitoring period as a result of the eutrophication of the lakes in Eastern China.

Leveraging on moderate resolution satellite data, such as Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), offers unique opportunities for monitoring surface water availability and drought impacts. In this study, we assessed the extent to which Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data can be used to characterise and monitor the impacts of drought on water resources in the Western Cape, South Africa. Multispectral indices including Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI+5) were computed to determine the most suitable method for surface water detection and drought monitoring. Sentinel-2-derived NDVI emerged as the most suitable index for mapping surface waterbodies, demonstrating an overall accuracy of 77.27%. However, LSWI+5 exhibited limitations, misclassifying built-up and mountainous areas as surface waterbodies. SPI, VCI, and WRSI effectively identified drought periods and correlated well with climate data, revealing low rainfall and high evapotranspiration rates during the 2016–2018 drought period. These findings provide valuable insights into surface water variability and the impacts of drought on water resources. Overall, our study underscores the feasibility of utilizing moderate resolution datasets to assess drought impacts on surface water resources, enabling improved water resource management, drought detection, and preparedness efforts in resource limited environments.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","101037","","","32","","Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Drought detection; Multi-date monitoring; Multispectral indices; Satellite data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urban parks generally may enhance people's positive sentiments, but little is known about explicitly linking the landscape composition and configuration of urban parks directly with visitors' sentiments based on social media data. The main objective of this study, therefore, was to identify key landscape attributes that influence this relationship in the Beijing metropolitan region. We first crawled 55,441 valid text data items from Sina Weibo for 99 urban parks within the fifth ring road of Beijing. Then, we quantified the positive emotions of visitors to urban parks using social media data and sentiment analysis. Finally, we evaluated the differences in visitors' positive emotions among different types of parks and used Random Forest to identify urban park attributes that were correlated with positive emotions. We found that visitors to different types of urban parks had different levels of positive emotions. Specifically, visitors to comprehensive parks and cultural relics parks were significantly happier than visitors to community parks. Visitors to parks between the third and fourth ring roads in Beijing had the lowest levels of positive emotions. Positive emotions were found to be positively correlated with park size and the mean size of water bodies but negatively correlated with large areas of impervious surfaces. This study sheds new light on the relationship between park landscape patterns and visitors' positive emotions through a new approach based on social media data. The research methods and findings may inspire similar studies in other cities and countries, which are needed to improve park planning and management and thus enhance urban sustainability.","2022-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","104482","","","226","","Landscape and Urban Planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Big data; Cultural services; Deep learning; Ecosystem services; Green and blue spaces; Human well-being; Urban landscape sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we propose a novel GIS approach to assess spatial and temporal changes in transportation infrastructure pressure on NWHS in Southeast Asia using a Transportation Infrastructure Pressure Index (TIPI) and forest fragmentation analysis, underpinned by global open-source datasets. Mean pressure in Southeast Asian NWHS is lower than in their surrounding areas (15 km), suggesting that NWHS protection is preventing some deterioration. However, in the last 5 years, these sites have also come under increasing transportation infrastructure pressure (at a mean rate of 14.9% over the period 2014–2019 across 12 sites in Southeast Asia). Furthermore, increases in transportation pressure in NWHS surrounding areas are correlated with increases in transportation pressure inside NWHS. With transportation infrastructure projected to continue to expand globally, GIS-based analysis methods such as these could enhance existing NWHS monitoring efforts, providing early warning about pressures that may be contributing to forest degradation and biodiversity declines in NWHS.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","109564","","","270","","Biological Conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Forest fragmentation; Forest loss; Southeast Asia; Transportation infrastructure; Tropical forests; World heritage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through the in-depth demand analysis including quantification of energy consumption dynamics and consumer preferences, energy decision-makers can develop reasonable and forethoughtful energy efficiency plans and demand-response programs. Previous work in energy-demand behavioral research relied primarily on ideal socio-economic models or data-driven approaches, both of which lack flexibility, intuition and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal visual analysis approach for urban energy consumption pattern discovery in order to identify energy-saving potentials, plan energy supply and improve energy efficiency. In this approach, energy consumption time series are embeded into a two-dimensional scatterplot for coordinated visual exploration. Users can interactively explore and discover different patterns for decision-making purposes. In addition, we propose the method for modeling energy demand shift patterns based on a potential flow method and integrate it into a pattern exploration tool. The proposed approach is comprehensively evaluated through empirical studies using the real-world electricity consumption data from Pudong district, Shanghai. We identify five typical energy consumption patterns and demand shift patterns across different geographical locations, which can be well interpreted by the knowledge of energy consumption in the area of interest. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the tool.

GPP was decoupled from ET at some schemes. For example, at the Landela sub-block of the Silalatshani irrigation scheme in Zimbabwe, GPP and T increased at 4.8% and 4.6% per year, respectively. Conversely, E decreased at 13.5% per year, giving a 3.6% decrease in ET per year from 2013 to 2021.

HPHS has a significant impact on industrial and agricultural production, people's lifestyles, and public health. However, the characteristics of HPHS with respect to changes and influencing factors have not been fully investigated using dynamic classification of urban, suburban, and rural stations based on absolute and relative thresholds of seven HPHS indices in Southwest China. The results of this study revealed that, first, during the period 1961–2019, the normal annual and seasonal HPHS values and extreme HPHS days increased significantly, while the extreme HPHS values for the seven HPHS indices decreased. Second, based on the absolute and relative thresholds, the frequency and intensity of the impact of urbanization differed in four regions, and in Yunnan and Guizhou in particular. Different HPHS indices and different dynamic station classification methods result in different estimations of the effects of urbanization on annual and seasonal changes in the regional climate. Therefore, choosing an appropriate dynamic station classification method and considering the applicability of different indices in different seasons in different regions is very important. Third, the Granger causality test shows that the percentage of stations with Granger causality between landscape composition indices and seven extreme HPHS is the highest among all influencing factors.

This study focused on an artificial lake-river system in Shanghai featuring a spiderweb-structure, it is expected to detect whether the tributaries in such a system made a protective and buffering effect on the lake under the impact of rainfall runoff. A hydrodynamic model was established using MIKE 21, one of the most widely used software which can conduct two-dimensional modeling of water quality changes in surface water, to simulate the changes of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), the key indicators causing lake eutrophication, under different rainfall events. The results showed that, under various conditions, storm events almost have no first or final effect on the central lake, TN and TP in the lake were improved by 5%–18% and 1%–12% among monitoring stations. However, Obvious negative effects were displayed in the water quality of radial – circular tributaries, and the first effects in circular tributaries were more serious than those on the radial because their difference in hydrological condition. With the increase of rainfall intensity, the peak value of the pollutant concentration in circular rivers increased 63%–185% as compared with the initial. As to final effects, some circular rivers were significantly impacted, and the pollutant concentration increased by approximately 40% in the seventh day as rainfall started. It was deduced that tributaries played as protective buffer against pollutants in this spiderweb water system, in that pollutants would be degraded in such dense spiderweb-structured river systems before entering the central lake, and rainfall runoff would also accelerate the flow in rivers and lakes. Therefore, the paper hold that, the central lake could not be separated from the radial – circular tributaries, and the officially planned pumps and sluices in the river estuaries would not be recommended. This study would provide technical support for the planning, construction and ecological protection of artificial urban lake-river system in similar areas.","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","139566","","","429","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lake-river system; MIKE 21; Rainfall runoff; Spiderweb-structured; Water quality modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, street view image has become promising data for assessing an urban micro environment. This study aimed to use street view data and deep learning technique to examine the association between street-level built environment and urban poverty in Guangzhou, China, from a geographical heterogeneity perspective. First, we measured urban poverty in Guangzhou based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Second, we used the Pyramid Scene Parsing Network model for image segmentation and then performed principal component analysis to extract five major street view factors (i.e., vegetation enclosure sense, color complexity sense, road openness sense, sky openness sense, and building enclosure sense) from the street view data. Third, we conducted the geographical detector analysis to examine how street view factors is associated with urban poverty. Results suggested that vegetation enclosure sense, color complexity sense, and road openness sense are significantly related to the spatial heterogeneity of urban poverty. Among all factors, vegetation enclosure sense played a leading role. The results also confirmed the coexistence of different street view factors have association with the spatial heterogeneity of urban poverty. In conclusion, street-level built environment is generally associated with urban poverty, and therefore our proposed method can be considered as an efficiently method for identifying urban poor communities.","2023-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","102980","","","156","","Applied Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Geographical detector; Geographical heterogeneity; Street view image; Street-level built environment; Urban poverty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposed a complete methodology for simulating future changes in water resources and distinguishing the independent and synergistic effects of climate change and land use change. The coupling prediction model of land use and the global climate models were used for scenario predictions; the hydrological model and statistical methods were used for simulations and analyses. The Ganjiang River, the largest tributary of Poyang Lake, is chosen as the study area. In the future, the main trend of change in land use would be the expansion of construction land in the northern part of the basin, and the future annual precipitation and temperature (p < 0.5) would increase. In this basin, runoff is more sensitive to climate change than to land use/cover change, and the synergistic effects are not substantial. Most climate scenarios showed a significant change in monthly peak runoff. The current peak is in June; this is projected to decrease with the simulated future peak in August, causing problems in basin flood control and Poyang Lake water level regulation. This study proposed a methodology integrating the global climate models with predicted land use scenarios and tested the feasibility at the watershed scale by the case study.

Studies have largely focused on the geopolitical impact (i.e., politics and international relations) but less is known about social and environmental impact. This is in large part because consistent, high-resolution, cross-boundary social and environmental data at large scales are rather limited. To address the knowledge gap, this research developed a novel Socio-Environmental Sensing (SES) approach by synthesizing remote sensing imagery and geotagged Twitter data to map the socio-environmental impact of LSIPs. We demonstrated the applicability of this approach using two BRI flagship projects, namely, the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) in Kenya and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in Pakistan. Our analysis shows that both projects have led to a substantial loss of natural land (e.g., 3.7 % loss of vegetation in Kenya, and 23.3 % reduction of the glacier in Pakistan) but gains in artificial land (e.g., 4.2 % increase in cropland in Kenya, and 34.6 % expansion of built-up land in Pakistan). In addition, the BRI-LSIPs have largely improved local economic development, because nighttime light imagery revealed that regions near the BRI-LSIP sites became much brighter than other regions. Regarding the social aspect, we found that public sentiment toward the projects was largely positive and improved over time, which contradicts the prevalent pessimism to BRI-LSIPs by critics. Nevertheless, sentiment also presented strong spatial heterogeneity – regions around the BRI transportation hubs (usually large cities) most showed more positive sentiment than other regions. By spatially joining the georeferenced sentiment scores with environmental indicators from remote sensing, we further found that positive sentiment improved more in more developed regions, but only changed slightly in other regions. This study provides a novel approach to assess the socio-environmental impact of large-scale projects, and the findings would be useful for informing the implementation of future BRI projects across the globe.","2021-10-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","527-540","","","124","","Environmental Science & Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Belt and road initiative; Integrated analysis; Large-scale infrastructure; Remote sensing; Social sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These areas also offer strong carbon sequestration and storage capacity. However, human activities and climate change have led to an ongoing decline in wetland areas. As an important wetland reserve in China, the coastal wetlands of Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, bring together a great number of water resources, land resources, biological resources, landscape resources, mineral resources, energy resources, and many other resources. However, in recent years, the coastal wetlands of Yancheng have also faced a continuous reduction in area. In this study, an integrated model of the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and multi-criteria evaluation-cellular automata-Markov (MCE-CA-Markov) model was designed to determine the importance of the driving factors of landscape pattern change and predict the landscape pattern of coastal wetlands in 2025, based on the analysis of landscape pattern changes in 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 in Yancheng coastal wetlands, Jiangsu Province. The results showed that the landscape configuration of coastal wetlands in Yancheng changed significantly during 2005–2020. The total natural wetland landscape area declined steadily over that 15-year span, showing a total decrease of 2.971×104 ha; on the contrary, the artificial wetlands increased. The analysis of the driving factors of wetland damage showed that gross domestic product (GDP), distance to roads, and average precipitation were the key factors. Based on this model, the natural wetland landscape of Yancheng’s coastal wetlands is predicted to decline sharply in 2025, and the wetland salt marsh vegetation will be extensively converted to aquaculture and agricultural land. Constructed land is predicted to increase significantly, and the trend of urban expansion is obvious. The study concludes with practical suggestions for the sustainable development and ecological conservation of the Yancheng coastal wetland ecosystem based on the predicted scenario.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","109735","","","145","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal wetland; Extreme Gradient Boosting(XGBoost); Landscape prediction; Multi-Criteria Evaluation-Cellular Automata-Markov","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands encourages the development of frameworks for national action and international cooperation for ensuring conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources at local, national and regional scales. However, the implementation of these frameworks remains a challenge. This is mainly due to limited availability of high-resolution data and suitable big data processing techniques for assessing and monitoring wetland ecohydrological dynamics at large spatial scales, particularly in the sub-Saharan African region. The availability of cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) offers unique big data handling and processing opportunities to address some of these challenges. In this study, we applied the GEE cloud computing platform to monitor the long-term ecohydrological dynamics of a seasonally flooded part of the Nylsvley floodplain wetland complex in north-eastern South Africa over a 20-year period (2000–2020). The specific objectives of the study were 1) to evaluate wetland ecohydrological dynamics using the 20-year multi-date Landsat composite data coupled with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm, and 2) to establish the major drivers of wetland ecohydrological changes, using selected spectral indices (i.e. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalised Difference Phenology Index (NDPI)) coupled with climate data. The ecohydrology of the wetland changed over time, with some classes increasing twice when compared to the previous measurement, while others decreasing significantly during the study period. Notably, the bare surface class increased at rates of 230% and 350% between 2006–2010 and 2016–2020, respectively. Moreover, the indices showed similar trends throughout the 20-year period, with NDWI having minimum values less than zero in all cases. This implied no surface inundation, although the presence of some wetland vegetation indicated seasonal to semi-permanent soil saturation conditions. A comparative analysis of climate data and remotely sensed indices showed that annual changes of precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of wetland ecohydrological variations. The findings of the study underscore the relevance of cloud computing artificial intelligence techniques, and particularly the GEE platform, in evaluating wetland ecohydrological dynamics for semi-arid southern African systems which are deteriorating due to the unsustainable use and poor management resulting from limited knowledge about their changes over time.","2022-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:46","2024-01-19 10:23:46","","128080","","","612","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Dryland wetland; Ephemeral wetland; Machine learning algorithm; Wetland condition; Wetland management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the spatial scales of water use and available water resources are often not matched due to their different ways for data surveying or observing. The spatial distributed (grid-scale) water use map is one of the ways to convert the spatial scales of the water use and available water resources. As irrigation is essential to guarantee sustainable development of agriculture, food security and economy, and accounts for most water use in China. A framework to generate high resolution (1 km) annual irrigation water use maps has been proposed. An iterative input variables selection (IIS) algorithm is adopted to select the optimal input variables among candidate input variables. After determining the optimal input variables, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is built to establish the relationship between the selected input variables and the irrigation water use. The spatial distributed irrigation water use maps can be produced by the trained CNN with the selected input variables at grid scale. The spatial distributed annual irrigation water use maps in China is produced at 1 km resolution from 1998 to 2013, and the performance of the framework has been proven to be credible with three metrics (i.e., root mean squared error, Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and relative error). Based on the spatial distributed annual irrigation water use maps, the spatial autocorrelation of annual irrigation water use in China is weak and the clustered pattern is random with 99% confidence. The temporal changing pattern mainly depends on precipitation and soil moisture in most prefectures, and the change of the cultivated area can also lead to dramatic change of the annual irrigation water use in China. The proposed framework can generate high resolution spatial distributed annual irrigation water use maps at grid scale, and the maps can be applied to ensure the optimal water resources allocation to realize efficient utilization of water resources and the agricultural policy-making.","2023-06-15","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","136974","","","405","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual irrigation water use; CNN; High resolution; Input variable selection; Spatial distributed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In light of this, it would expect to leverage technologies to create new services and values for various stakeholders including the agriculture community during this pandemic. The digitally endorsed performance management envisaged under this framework, along with relevant policy measures, is supposed to be building an agile architecture that would not incur technical debt in a newly formed cultural position.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","79-91","","1","2","","New Techno Humanities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Commercial agriculture; Connected laboratories; Digital transformation; Performance management; Smart research institutes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we do the first global attempt to characterize the complexity of urbanization from 1975 to 2015 in terms of population, built-up structure, and greenness per 5 × 5 km2 grid covering global inhabited areas, using Earth Observation data sources. Our results emphasize the multifaceted nature of urbanization that varies greatly across regions and times, in addition to the steady expansion of built-up land. Increased population density and built-up patch density were the dominant characteristics in Asia and Africa, while urbanization in Europe and North America took a rather steady pace, combined with widespread greening. According to the urbanization types identified by a self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm, a large proportion of urban and suburban areas experienced two dynamic urbanization types – built-up extension/leapfrog and built-up infill with large population increase. During different historical periods (1975–1990, 1990–2000, and 2000–2015), annual rates of increase in population and built-up density were slowing coinciding with an increasing greenness – signaling that urbanization processes are becoming less intense, more compact, and ‘greener’ over the most recent period. Our findings facilitate the comprehensive understanding of global urbanization that is a complex process with many local variations and characteristics, and underscore the need for region-based strategies towards sustainable development instead of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ policy for cities.","2022-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","104316","","","219","","Landscape and Urban Planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Built-up expansion; Greenness loss; Population change; Social–land cover–environment interactions; Urbanization types","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study reports on the use of satellite-based synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral imagery for estimating AGB by correlating satellite observations with ground truth data collected on forest plots from dryland forests in the Chobe National Park, Botswana. We undertook nineteen quantitative experiments with Sentinel-1 (S1), and Sentinel-2 (S2) and tested simple and multivariate regression including parametric (linear) and non-parametric (random forests) algorithms, to explore the optimal approaches for AGB estimation. The largest AGB value of 145 Mg/ha was found in northern Chobe while a large part of the study area (85%) is characterized by low AGB values (< 80 Mg/ha), with an average estimated at 51 Mg/ha. The results show that the AGB estimated using SAR backscatter values from vertical transmit receive (VV) polarization is more accurate than that based on horizontal receive (VH) polarization, accounting for 58% of the variance compared to 32%. Nevertheless, the combination of S1 SAR and S2 multispectral image data produced the best fit to the ground observations for dryland forests explaining 83% of the variance with an accuracy of 89%. Furthermore, the optimal AGB model performance was achieved with a random forest (RF) regression trees algorithm using S1 (SAR) and S2 (multispectral) image data (R2 = 0.95; RMSE = 0.25 Mg/ha). From the 11 vegetation indices tested, GNDVI, Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE1), and NDVI obtained the highest linear relationship with AGB (R2 = 0.71 and R2 = 0.56, p < 0.001), however, GNDVI and NDRE1 improved the AGB estimation at medium to high-density forests compared to NDVI. The GRVI and EVI were the least correlated with AGB (R2 = 0.09 and R2 = 0.31) at a significance level of p < 0.001, respectively. We show that NDVI saturates in areas with >80 Mg/ha AGB, whereas the inclusion of SAR backscatter and optical red edge bands (B5) significantly reduces saturation effects in areas of high biomass. GNDVI and red edge (B5) derived vegetation indices have more potential for estimating AGB in dryland forests than NDVI. Our results demonstrate that dryland AGB can be estimated with a reasonable level of precision from open access Earth observation data using multivariate random forest regression.","2022-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","113232","","","282","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Above ground biomass; Chobe; Conservation; Dryland forests; Linear regression; Random forest; SAR; Sentinel; Southern Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These techniques facilitate the interpretation and understanding of decisions made by AI models, promoting transparency and trust. However, the current state of XAI applications in DRM, their achievements, and the challenges they face remain underexplored. In this systematic literature review, we delve into the burgeoning domain of XAI-DRM, extracting 195 publications from the Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, and selecting 68 for detailed analysis based on predefined exclusion criteria. Our study addresses pertinent research questions, identifies various hazard and disaster types, risk components, and AI and XAI methods, uncovers the inherent challenges and limitations of these approaches, and provides synthesized insights to enhance their explainability and effectiveness in disaster decision-making. Notably, we observed a significant increase in the use of XAI techniques for DRM in 2022 and 2023, emphasizing the growing need for transparency and interpretability. Through a rigorous methodology, we offer key research directions that can serve as a guide for future studies. Our recommendations highlight the importance of multi-hazard risk analysis, the integration of XAI in early warning systems and digital twins, and the incorporation of causal inference methods to enhance DRM strategy planning and effectiveness. This study serves as a beacon for researchers and practitioners alike, illuminating the intricate interplay between XAI and DRM, and revealing the profound potential of AI solutions in revolutionizing disaster risk management.","2023-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","104123","","","98","","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data-driven decision making; Hazard and disaster type; Interpretable artificial intelligence; Resilience building; Transparency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primarily, how do we produce more, but in a way that is healthier for the animals, public, and the environment? Implementing a smart agri-systems approach, utilising multiplatform precision technologies, internet of things, data analytics, machine learning, digital twinning and other emerging technologies can support a more informed decision-making and forecasting position that will allow us to move towards greater sustainability in future. If we look to precision agronomy, there are a wide range of technologies available and examples of how digitalisation and integration of platform outputs can lead to advances in understanding the agricultural system and forecasting upcoming events and performance that have hitherto been impossible to achieve. There is much for the livestock sector and animal scientists to learn from the developments of precision technologies and smart agri-system approaches in the arable and horticultural contexts. However, there are several barriers the livestock sector must overcome: (i) the development and implementation of precision livestock farming technologies that can be easily integrated and analysed without the support of a dedicated data analyst in house; (ii) the lack of extensive validation of many developed and available precision livestock farming technologies means that reliability and accuracy are likely to be compromised when applied in commercial practice; (iii) the best smart agri-systems approaches are reliant on large quantities of data from across a wide variety of conditions, but at present the complications of data sharing, commercial sensitivities, data ownership, and permissions make it challenging to obtain or knit together data from different parts of the system into a comprehensive picture; and (iv) the high level of investment needed to develop and scale these technologies is substantial and represents significant risk for companies when a technology is emerging. Using a case study of the National Pig Centre (a flagship pig research facility in the UK) we discuss how a smart agri-systems approach can be applied in practice to investigate alternative future systems for production, and enable monitoring of these systems as a commercial demonstrator site for future pork production.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","100518","","","16","","animal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital farming; Pork; Precision Livestock Farming; Production; Systems approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To close these gaps, this study conducted in China's southwest karst area explored the simultaneous responses of soil loss and ESs to human interventions and identified their spatial determinants by applying biophysical models and an integrated regression approach, respectively. The results showed that, from 1980 to 2017, ERPs substantially enhanced soil retention (SR) for both sub-catchment and entire region scales, and the soil loss has greatly declined since 1999. Carbon stock (CS) and habitat quality remained relatively stable over the entire region, while precipitation variations resulted in fluctuations in water yield (WY) and aquatic purification (AP). Pairwise correlations demonstrated that WY and AP had a significant synergy (p < 0.0001) across all provinces, while CS and WY presented a negative association for Guangxi and Guizhou provinces. Spatial panel models and geographically weighted regressions determined that environmental, socioeconomic, and landscape variables were the primary spatial determinants of multiple ESs and soil loss, and presented significant spatial heterogeneity and spillover effects. Therefore, SR and other ESs should be closely linked, to concurrently address land degradation and enhance ESs. In ERPs and LDN practices, environmental, socioeconomic, and landscape variables and their external effects should be taken into account to propose targeted, integrated, and efficient policies and strategies to facilitate win–win outcomes and realize regional sustainable development.","2022-08-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","106693","","","181","","Ecological Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Afforestation projects; Karst landform; Landscape metrics; Soil erosion control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although SIF contains more physiological information than NIRvP, NIRvP can have higher data quality and spatio-temporal resolution. Therefore, the two variables can be considered complementary for GPP monitoring. Here, we propose a simple framework to combine SIF and NIRvP data from different data sources to generate an enhanced SIF product (eSIF). The original SIF data comes from the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-5P mission, whereas NIRvP data are derived from MODIS spectral reflectance and ERA5 reanalysis data. The resulting eSIF product has a spatial resolution of 0.05° and a temporal resolution of 8 days, as well as a higher signal-to-noise ratio and a lower angular dependency than the original TROPOMI SIF data. Our results demonstrate that eSIF has similar spatial patterns to the original SIF but is more spatially continuous and less noisy. Comparisons with the FLUXCOM global GPP product show that eSIF has a more universal relationship with GPP than NIRvP for different grass/crop plant functional types (the coefficients of variation are 18.9% for slopes of GPP to eSIF and 27.3% for slopes of GPP to NIRvP), but NIRvP outperforms eSIF for tracking GPP for forest PFTs exclude BoENF. Moreover, eSIF is able to better track the seasonal variations in GPP related to environmental stresses. This study highlights that our methodology based on the combination of SIF and NIRvP is a promising approach for better monitoring of GPP.","2023-01-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","113341","","","284","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gross primary productivity (GPP); Multi-source data combination; Near-infrared radiation reflected by vegetation (NIRvP); Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous Global Aquatic Land Cover (GALC) mapping has been focused on water bodies while lacking information on vegetation, and aquatic types have always been characterized by low accuracies in global land cover products, calling for specific attention to improve GALC mapping. The availability of a wealth of open Earth Observation (EO) data on cloud-computing platforms provides opportunities to map aquatic land cover globally. This study aims to evaluate the potential of multi-source freely available EO data, including optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and various ancillary datasets, for improving the characterization of aquatic land cover comprising both water and vegetation types on a global scale. Using different combinations of features derived from these data, the classification performance of five land cover classes (i.e., trees, shrubs, herbaceous cover, bare/sparsely vegetated lands, and water bodies) in aquatic areas was cross-validated. Results showed that Sentinel-2 data alone achieved similarly good overall accuracy as those combining multi-source data. However, the single-sensor Sentinel-2 data cannot discriminate highly mixed and spectrally similar types, such as shrubs, trees, and herbaceous vegetation. Integrating SAR features from the ALOS/PALSAR mosaic and Sentinel-1 data with optical features provided by Sentinel-2 data could help address this limitation to some extent. Although with a lower spatial and temporal resolution, the ALOS/PALSAR mosaic had a stronger impact on GALC classification than Sentinel-1 data when they were synergistically used. Features provided by ancillary datasets did not lead to significant improvement in the overall GALC classification. At class-level, topographic and soil features helped to reduce the commission error of shrubs, and climate variables were useful to improve the characterization of bare aquatic lands. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) forest canopy height dataset helped to characterize trees but also resulted in a decrease in accuracies of shrubs. By assessing multi-source earth observation data, this research represents an important step forward in the global mapping of comprehensive aquatic land cover types at high spatial resolution (i.e., 10 m).","2022-09-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","113103","","","278","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ALOS/PALSAR; Global aquatic land cover mapping; Multi-source earth observation data; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cropland ecosystem services are impacted by both cultivation practices and the natural environment, which lead to high heterogeneity. Therefore, making clear the cropland ecosystem service value (CESV) dynamic and its driving factors are still a great challenge in agricultural production areas. Jiangxi Province is located in eastern China and it is one of the main grain production regions in China but face great pressure of cropland degradation due to rapid industrialization and urbanization in the past two decades. However, the knowledge on the spatio-temporal variation of CESV and related dominators is largely retain unclear in Jiangxi Province. To fill this gap, we integrated different biophysical models and value estimation methods to map the CESV in Jiangxi Province. The CESV from 2001 to 2020 was mapped with a spatial resolution of 1 km, and the temporal trend was explored using Theil-Sen and Mann-Kendall test method. Subsequently, the influencing pathways of both natural and anthropogenic driving factors on CESV were contrasted utilizing partial least squares structural equation modeling. The spatial correlation and heterogeneity between CESV and its driving factors was also revealed by the bivariate Moran's I method. Finally, the geographically weighted regression was adopted to identify spatially-varying primary driving factors which dominate the variation of CESV across the study area. Our results revealed that: (1) the CESV in Jiangxi province increased from 257.84 billion yuan to 312.37 billion yuan from 2001 to 2020; (2) the CESV in most of the study area (97.47%) was featured by an increasing trend; (3) vegetation and terrain factors have the highest contribution to the variation of CESV, followed by soil properties; (4) the CESV was positively correlated with saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, clay, elevation, slope, leaf area index, vegetation cover fraction in the study area, while significantly negatively correlated with population density and nighttime light index; (5) the proportion of areas where CESV was dominated by vegetation cover fraction was the largest, followed by saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, elevation, and slope. Based on our findings, we put forward several suggestions to underpin sustainable cropland ecosystem management and development. Our research offers an insightful understanding of spatio-temporal heterogeneity of CESV and can provide important implications and useful guidance for enhancing the ecosystem functions of cropland.","2023-11-15","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","139228","","","427","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bivariate Moran's I; Cropland ecosystem service value; Geographically weighted regression; Partial least squares structural equation modeling; Primary driving factors; Spatio-temporal heterogeneity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study on LST and UHI can be performed to investigate the spatiotemporal variation in dynamics of land surface temperature and satellite-derived indices for enhanced urban planning and development. The study undertakes a comprehensive assessment for the city of Bangalore to understand its impact on environmental quality. The corresponding satellite-derived indices like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) are used to express the Built-up area (BUA) to analyse the dynamics of LST on UHI profiles. The results of the study reveal that the mean LST has a positive correlation for impervious surfaces and a negative correlation with the green surfaces, which is common for all Indian cities and it results in degradation of environmental eminence. The results shows that the area has undergone a drastic transformation and has resulted in a rise in overall temperature and UHI intensity due to an increase of urbanized areas by 3% between 2007 and 2020.

An indispensable initial step in commissioning PV–hydrogen hybrid systems involves analyzing in-depth its capacity configuration, operation strategy, and economic benefits. With the objective of maximizing the annual profit of such systems, this work formulates a capacity optimization model and performs related economic analysis, with pre-determined installed capacity and plant layout. Two aspects distinguish this work from its predecessors: (1) The physical (i.e., model chain) modeling of PV is employed to narrate the behavior of the PV plant in a more refined fashion, and (2) the impact of government support on the configuration and economics of PV–hydrogen hybrid systems is analyzed by incorporating into the objective function environmental benefits subsidized by the government. Besides, sensitivity analysis is conducted for numerous parameters that can affect the configuration outcome. The proposed model is applied under the climate regime of Heilongjiang Province, China, and the veracity and validity of the proposed model are verified via case studies. The results reveal that a 1-MW PV plant requires a transformer of 226.9 kW, electrolyzers of 366.8 kW, and 3 compressors, when the physical modeling of PV is utilized. The exorbitant investment cost of hydrogen tanks and hydrogen fuel cells renders these devices unsuitable for use in PV–hydrogen hybrid systems. The advantages of physical modeling of PV enable an increase of 38.9% in the annual profit of the hybrid systems, compared to the conventional modeling of PV using only surrogate equations. Furthermore, it is found that government subsidy policy, various prices and costs, and the utilization rate of PV power are among the most influencing factors affecting the optimal capacity and economics of the hybrid systems. In solar-rich areas of Heilongjiang, it is preferable to equip electrolyzers with a larger capacity and to install a transformer with a smaller rating power, to achieve a higher annual profit. The levelized cost of electricity of PV–hydrogen hybrid systems is 0.03 $/kWh, the levelized cost of hydrogen is 2.9 $/kg, and the payback time is ∼11 years. These results could serve as a benchmark for future PV–hydrogen hybrid system development, and offer information that is of interest to policymakers, operators, and investors, thereby contributing to the realization of zero-carbon energy systems.","2023-07-15","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","117128","","","288","","Energy Conversion and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Economic analysis; Hydrogen; Model chain; PV–hydrogen hybrid systems; Solar power curve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study used Landsat collection and annual average climate data from the growing season to investigate the efficacy of established land management policies to restore degraded land and reverse the aeolian desertification process in the Shiyang river basin between 1974 and 2020. The time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) results revealed that greening and browning trend patterns depend on climatic conditions in rangelands and water allocation management systems in farmlands. Thanks to land rehabilitation and watershed management projects, farmland has been extended to 3.1%, shifting sand area has been reduced to 9.2%, and water in Qingtu lake area re-emergedfrom 0 to 17.05 Km2 in the early 2010 s. Built-up areas also extended to 87.05 km2 between 2010 and 2020 due to extensive construction of solar power panels in the area. The severity of desertification is profoundly linked to climate and land-use management systems in the Shiyang river basin. Moreover, the ADL area declined from 14.65% to 10.74% of the entire river basin, where intensity has steadily reversed in several basin parts, mainly in the middle reach. Around 2248 km2 of land were entirely rehabilitated, 2298 km2 remained steady, 1706 km2 exhibited a reverse in desertification intensity, 199 km2 degraded, and 277 km2 of land were newly turned into ADL between 1974 and 2020, with a large portion of degraded land occurred in the lower reach of the Basin. These findings highlight land management contribution, rational water allocation, and conservation measures to reverse desertification and maintain a sustainable ecosystem despite climate change impacts and water resources shortage in the Shiyang river basin. This research will help decision-makers set up novel land management programs for better eco-environment development in the future.","2022-06-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","108882","","","139","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aeolian Desertified Land (ADL); Arid and Semi-arid area; Google earth engine code editor; Land-use Land cover (LULC); NDVI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After collecting data for almost 40,000 buildings in the United Kingdom, we combine these data sources by training multiple end-to-end deep learning models with the objective to classify buildings as energy efficient (EU rating A–D) or inefficient (EU rating E–G). After evaluating the trained models quantitatively as well as qualitatively, we extend our analysis by studying the predictive power of each data source in an ablation study. We find that the end-to-end deep learning model trained on all four data sources achieves a macro-averaged F1 score of 64.64% and outperforms models trained on building energy consumption data by 9.78%. As industry experts use building energy consumption data to approximate a building’s energy efficiency prior to a potential on-site inspection, this work shows the potential and complementary nature of remotely sensed data in predicting energy efficiency and opens up new opportunities for future work to integrate additional data sources.","2023-03-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","120542","","","333","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ablation study; Building energy efficiency; Decarbonization; End-to-end deep learning; Remote sensing; Retrofitting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to evaluate the potentiality of the new NTL imagery – SDGSAT-1 – in revealing the spatial variation in NTL intensity. We compared the NTL image from SDGSAT-1 with other existing NTL datasets: the Visible infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite-Day Night Band (VIIRS-DNB), Luojia1-1 (LJ1-01), and photographs from the International Space Station (ISS-P) at spatial resolutions of 500 m, 130 m, and 10 m, respectively. Then, we investigated the intraurban NTL spatial variability of eleven urban land-use types with analysis of variance (ANOVA). In addition, we used random forest (RF) regression to analyze the relationship between explanatory factors and NTL variation. The results showed the following: (1) The quality of the SDGSAT-1 NTL image was comparable with ISS-P and better than VIIRS-DNB and LJ1-01 imagery in spectral and spatial resolution. (2) The ability of the RGB bands and grayscale brightness of the SDGSAT-1 NTL image to distinguish various land use types outperformed that of the ISS-P, LJ1-01, and VIIRS-DNB images. (3) The NTL spectral index SONDI, combined with three visible bands, could improve the ability of a single band to show the lighting differences in intraurban areas. (4) The nine variables explained 39.20%–42.30% of the NTL intensity variability in the four RF models. Road density and public POI density were the most important variables in the red-green and blue bands, indicating that high-pressure sodium and lighting-emitting diode lamps were primarily deployed in the road and public areas, respectively. Meanwhile, the potential applications of SDGSAT-1 NTL imagery were further discussed.

The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission providing a systematic 5-day revisit cycle and free data access opens a completely new avenue for near real-time crop specific monitoring at parcel level over large countries. This research investigated the feasibility to propose methods and to develop an open source system able to generate, at national scale, cloud-free composites, dynamic cropland masks, crop type maps and vegetation status indicators suitable for most cropping systems. The so-called Sen2-Agri system automatically ingests and processes Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series in a seamless way to derive these four products, thanks to streamlined processes based on machine learning algorithms and quality controlled in situ data. It embeds a set of key principles proposed to address the new challenges arising from countrywide 10 m resolution agriculture monitoring. The full-scale demonstration of this system for three entire countries (Ukraine, Mali, South Africa) and five local sites distributed across the world was a major challenge met successfully despite the availability of only one Sentinel-2 satellite in orbit. In situ data were collected for calibration and validation in a timely manner allowing the production of the four Sen2-Agri products over all the demonstration sites. The independent validation of the monthly cropland masks provided for most sites overall accuracy values higher than 90%, and already higher than 80% as early as the mid-season. The crop type maps depicting the 5 main crops for the considered study sites were also successfully validated: overall accuracy values higher than 80% and F1 Scores of the different crop type classes were most often higher than 0.65. These respective results pave the way for countrywide crop specific monitoring system at parcel level bridging the gap between parcel visits and national scale assessment. These full-scale demonstration results clearly highlight the operational agriculture monitoring capacity of the Sen2-Agri system to exploit in near real-time the observation acquired by the Sentinel-2 mission over very large areas. Scaling this open source system on cloud computing infrastructure becomes instrumental to support market transparency while building national monitoring capacity as requested by the AMIS and GEOGLAM G-20 initiatives.","2019-02-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","551-568","","","221","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Agriculture monitoring; Cloud computing; Crop type mapping; Cropland; Machine learning; Sentinel-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we provide a data-driven alignment of chlorophyll-a and turbidity derived from the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) with corresponding Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) products. For chlorophyll-a retrieval, empirical ‘ocean colour’ blue-green band ratios and a near infra-red (NIR) band ratio algorithm, as well as a semi-analytical three-band NIR-red ratio algorithm, were included in the analysis. Six million co-registrations with MSI and OLCI spanning 24 lakes across five continents were analysed. Following atmospheric correction with POLYMER, the reflectance distributions of the red and NIR bands showed close similarity between the two sensors, whereas the distribution for blue and green bands was positively skewed in the MSI results compared to OLCI. Whilst it is not possible from this analysis to determine the accuracy of reflectance retrieved with either MSI or OLCI results, optimizing water quality algorithms for MSI against those previously derived for the Envisat Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and its follow-on OLCI, supports the wider use of MSI for aquatic applications. Chlorophyll-a algorithms were thus tuned for MSI against concurrent OLCI observations, resulting in significant improvements against the original algorithm coefficients. The mean absolute difference (MAD) for the blue-green band ratio algorithm decreased from 1.95 mg m−3 to 1.11 mg m−3, whilst the correlation coefficient increased from 0.61 to 0.80. For the NIR-red band ratio algorithms improvements were modest, with the MAD decreasing from 4.68 to 4.64 mg m−3 for the empirical red band ratio algorithm, and 3.73 to 3.67 for the semi-analytical 3-band algorithm. Three implementations of the turbidity algorithm showed improvement after tuning with the resulting distributions having reduced bias. The MAD reduced from 0.85 to 0.72, 1.22 to 1.10 and 1.93 to 1.55 FNU for the 665, 708 and 778 nm implementations respectively. However, several sources of uncertainty remain: adjacent land showed high divergence between the sensors, suggesting that high product uncertainty near land continues to be an issue for small water bodies, while it cannot be stated at this point whether MSI or OLCI results are differentially affected. The effect of spectrally wider bands of the MSI on algorithm sensitivity to chlorophyll-a and turbidity cannot be fully established without further availability of in situ optical measurements.","2021-11-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","112651","","","265","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, identifying and prioritizing areas susceptible to this phenomenon is crucial for the implementation of efficient preventative measures. In this study, the empirical Erosion Potential Method (EPM) was used to quantify soil losses, and two Game Theory (GT) algorithms (Borda and Condorcet) were employed to identify locations prone to soil erosion and prioritize sub-watershed (SW) based on hydromorphometric characteristics in a hydrological system from High Atlas in Morocco. For this purpose, 26 factors were calculated, subsequently, a linear correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between potential soil erosion and various influencing factors. The EPM model findings indicated average loss rates of roughly 3356 m3/km2/year, which are corroborated by 217 inventory points gathered in the most productive sediment locations, with an AUC value of 80 %. The results of prioritization using GT algorithms show that the SW6 and SW8 are classified as areas with high vulnerability to soil erosion, and the sub-watersheds located upstream of the Lakhdar river watershed are the units that deserve prioritization in terms of planning intervention. The validation of results indicates that the Borda algorithm performed better (AUC= 92 %) than the Condorcet algorithm (AUC= 72 %). This innovative approach enhances our understanding of erosive processes within specific spatial units, enabling informed decision-making and making a substantial contribution to the sustainable and efficient management of water resources.

While existing studies have explored methods for large-scale monitoring of urban sprawl, most of them rely on the collection of manually labeled training samples for supervised classification. Additionally, previous studies generally focused on inland urban sprawl, neglecting the process of urban sprawl towards sea areas, known as seaward urban sprawl, which has profound ecological implications for coastal ecosystems. Here we develop a fully automatic algorithm for detecting urban sprawl, named Fully Automatic Detection of Urban Sprawl (FADUS), using the time-series Landsat imagery without manually collecting training samples or existing urban maps for reference. FADUS automatically generates initial samples through a sequential binary unsupervised clustering technique and then updates them by removing the spectral outliers to obtain a high-quality training set for subsequent supervised classification. A tidal module is included in FADUS to avoid pseudo-urban changes caused by tidal fluctuations so that both inland and seaward urban sprawl can be detected. By applying the algorithm to 75 coastal cities in China, the most rapidly urbanizing region in the world, we uncovered a neglected but dramatic seaward urban sprawl process that has converted sea areas to urban space since 1985. Our results indicate that 9904.36 km2 of coastal wetlands and nearshore seawater areas have been converted to land area, of which 44.83% is currently covered by built-up area. With our method, the fully automatic detection of urban dynamics is now possible for both coastal and inland cities worldwide. Our derived map of seaward urban sprawl in China provides valuable references for coastal land-cover change monitoring, wetland protection and restoration, and integrated coastal management.","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","113801","","","298","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Automatic classification; Change detection; Coastline; Google Earth Engine; Land cover; Landsat; Urban sprawl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is urgent and important to quantify the extent of the impact of armed conflicts on cropland. We applied the Sentinel dataset based on the GEE platform and used the time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method to map abandonment in six eastern oblasts and propose a cumulative NDVI (cumNDVI) method to characterize food production loss. The accuracy of the 2022 cropland abandonment in Krain was excellent. The overall accuracy was 92.5%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.85. The area of abandoned cropland in southeastern Ukraine was 11,892.49 km2, which was 7.17% of the cropland. The most abandoned cropland in Kherson was 26,692.22 km2, with 3,661.12 km2 of abandoned and a 13.72% abandonment rate. Because of abandonment, the loss of grain production in the six oblasts was from 3.67% to 15.18% respectively. And the other loss of grain production of cultivated cropland was found to be 33.02%, with a general loss characteristic in all regions except Donetsk slightly increased. In 2022, the grain production loss was a totally 8.19 million tons. That means the grain production loss of the six eastern oblasts in 2022 was up to 31.5% compared to the average yield level in 2016–2020 and accounted for 6.76% compared to the national grain production.

Numerous studies and methods have been published on this subject; however, these methods are difficult to apply in the real world because they are mainly based on remotely sensed landslides from a single sensor with a specific spatial resolution. Additionally, models built within deep learning frameworks tend to adopt similar encoder-decoder network structures, wherein many landslide features are easily filtered out by continuous convolutions. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deconvolution network to detect landslides. The model enlarges input feature maps by a deconvolution operation and convolutes the enlarged feature maps to learn to detect landslides. Moreover, the hierarchical structure enables the proposed network to better synthesize landslide features at a higher spatial resolution. An attention module is also proposed to enhance multi-scale landslide features. Our model is trained on four large earthquake-triggered landslide areas and one publicly released landslide dataset, where each dataset consists of hundreds to thousands of landslides. To mimic practical applications, the trained model is evaluated over three areas that recently experienced landslides. The performance of our proposed model is compared with six widely used frameworks, and it achieved a 21% higher F1-measure and at least 10% higher IOU using each of the evaluation landslide datasets. Additionally, the effectiveness of our model in maintaining landslide features, especially small landslides, is verified through comparisons with other commonly used frameworks, which demonstrate a strong potential use for practical cases.","2022-07-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","102853","","","111","","International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital disaster reduction; Landslide detection; Multi-scale landslide feature; Multiple spatial resolutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying which indicators are most appropriate for managers could improve wind erosion mitigation and restoration efforts. Vegetation cover directly protects the soil surface from erosive winds and reduces wind erosivity by extracting momentum from the air. The portion of the soil surface that is directly protected by vegetation is adequately described by fractional ground cover indicators. However, the aerodynamic sheltering effects of vegetation, which are more important for wind erosion than for water erosion, are not captured by these indicators. As wind erosion is a lateral process, the vertical structure and spatial distribution of vegetation are most important for controlling where, when, and how much wind erosion occurs on rangelands. These controlling factors can be described by indicators of the vegetation canopy gap size distribution and vegetation height, for which data are collected widely in the United States by standardized rangeland monitoring and assessment programs. In this paper we address why canopy gap size distribution and vegetation height are critical indicators of rangeland wind erosion and health. We review wind erosion processes to explain the physical role of these vegetation attributes. We then address the management implications including availability of data on the indicators on rangelands and needs to make the indicators and model estimates of wind erosion more accessible to the range management community.","2021-05-01","2024-01-19 10:23:47","2024-01-19 10:23:47","","78-83","","","76","","Rangeland Ecology & Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Canopy gap size; dust; monitoring; rangeland health; vegetation height; wind erosion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From 2010–2020, nine multi-nitrogen rates field trials were conducted at five sites involving different wheat varieties. Proximal sensing data were acquired from a Crop Circle sensor at key growth stages and meteorological data were aggregated from planting to the corresponding sensing date. Deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were adopted to estimate above-ground biomass, plant nitrogen uptake, plant nitrogen concentration, and the nitrogen nutrition index. Random forest (RF) was used as a benchmark regression model. Multi-task learning (MTL) based on DNN was conducted to estimate the four nitrogen indicators simultaneously. A genetic algorithm (GA) was tested to optimize the hyperparameters, connection weights, and loss function weights (for MTL) of neural networks separately. The results revealed that DNN (R2 =0.83–0.96) and MTL (R2 =0.81–0.96) achieved an overall comparable high accuracy with RF (R2 =0.83–0.97), whereas LSTM (R2 =0.76–0.93) did not improve the nitrogen status estimation in our dataset.

Trained with in-situ measured SDD and match-up Landsat images, we established various regression models to estimate SDD for global lakes. We selected a unified model which demonstrated good spatiotemporal transferability, and has potential to map SDD in different years with good quality of Landsat top-of-atmosphere (TOA) images embedded in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The unified model was successfully calibrated (n = 3586 data points, R2 = 0.84, MAPE = 29.8%) against SDD measured in 2235 lakes across the world, and the validation (n = 1779, R2 = 0.76, MAPE = 38.8%) also exhibited stable performance. The unified model was tuned to historical SDD measurements coincident with different Landsat sensors (L5-TM, L7-ETM+, L8-OLI) launched over the past four decades (1984–2020), thus confirming its temporal stability. Global SDD was mapped using GEE with OLI TOA products mainly acquired in 2019 to examine the spatial variation of lake water clarity (lake surface area ≥ 1 ha) all over the world. Worldwide, lake water clarity averaged 3.13 ± 1.71 m in 2019, but exhibited remarkable spatial variability due to catchment hydrological and landscape settings, lake morphology, elevation and anthropogenic impact. Inland waters in Europe (4.18 ± 1.82 m) and North America (3.84 ± 1.77 m) had the highest clarity due to greater water depth combined with less human disturbance in the high latitude regions. Lakes in South America (2.50 ± 2.33 m), Asia (2.44 ± 1.63 m) and Africa (2.36 ± 0.72 m) displayed intermediate clarity. Lakes in Oceania (1.97 ± 1.48 m) exhibited the lowest clarity for all continents except Antarctica. Further, we used the mapped SDD to evaluate water trophic status using the Carlson trophic state index. Our results indicate that, in 2019, about 63.6% of the lake areas and 47.8% of total lake numbers (2,219,627/4,646,056) were oligotrophic for global lakes, while about 23.6% areal percent and 37.1% of lake numbers are eutrophic mostly as a result of their being located in agricultural and urban-dominated drainage basins. This study, for the first time, provides water clarity information for lakes with area ≥ 1 ha all over the world with 30-m resolution and facilitates the understanding of the water clarity relevant to TSM (r = 0.95), Chl-a (r = 0.73), total phosphorus (r = 0.75), total nitrogen (r = 0.60), which could further provide water clarity data and technical support for trophic level evaluations as well.

After first obtaining the group sequence features of multitemporal RS images, then we use TGA modules to select time periods with large differences in phenology. And the TGA mechanism utilizes a “feature recalibration” strategy to highlight phenological differences, which firstly performs “group squeeze”, then “group excitation”, and finally performs “group reweighting”.

We developed surface inundation algorithms for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, respectively, at 12 sites across the conterminous United States (CONUS), covering a total of >536,000 km2 and representing diverse hydrologic and vegetation landscapes. Each scene in the 5-year (2017–2021) time series was classified into open water, vegetated water, and non-water at 20 m resolution using variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, as well as variables derived from topographic and weather datasets. The Sentinel-1 algorithm was developed distinct from the Sentinel-2 model to explore if and where the two time series could potentially be integrated into a single high-frequency time series. Within each model, open water and vegetated water (vegetated palustrine, lacustrine, and riverine wetlands) classes were mapped. The models were validated using imagery from WorldView and PlanetScope. Classification accuracy for open water was high across the 5-year period, with an omission and commission error of only 3.1% and 0.9% for the Sentinel-1 algorithm and 3.1% and 0.5% for the Sentinel-2 algorithm, respectively. Vegetated water accuracy was lower, as expected given that the class represents mixed pixels. The Sentinel-2 algorithm showed higher accuracy (10.7% omission and 7.9% commission error) relative to the Sentinel-1 algorithm (28.4% omission and 16.0% commission error). Patterns over time in the proportion of area mapped as open or vegetated water by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 algorithms were charted and correlated for a subset of all 12 sites. Our results showed that the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 algorithm open water time series can be integrated at all 12 sites to improve the temporal resolution, but sensor-specific differences, such as sensitivity to vegetation structure versus pixel color, complicate the data integration for mixed-pixel, vegetated water.

They are particularly evident in expansive urban centers such as Bangkok, Thailand's capital. Recent research has highlighted the escalation of temperatures and poor ventilation due to severe urbanization. Nevertheless, scant attention has been paid to both temperature and wind distribution. Concurrently, the imperatives of urban development policies require the integration of environmental and climatic factors. In this context, the present study delves into the UHIs in Bangkok and the climatic dynamics within the expansive Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR), encompassing six provinces. Utilizing climate data from 68 observation stations in 2019, this study aims to unravel the intricate interplay between air temperature distributions, wind distributions, and spatial environmental factors within the BMR, with the ultimate objective of constructing a comprehensive Urban Environmental Climate Map (UECM) tailored to the BMR. This study comprises three key stages. Initially, the authors classified the spatial-physical attributes of observation points, encompassing variables such as land use and land coverage (LULC). Subsequently, an exhaustive analysis was conducted to delve into the relationship between the climate distributions and spatial environmental factors. The insights lead to a refined UECM that encapsulates the BMR's climatic intricacy. The results of this study yield novel findings. Nocturnal air temperature fluctuations within the BMR exhibited a discernible correlation with green cover and proximity to water resources. Conversely, diurnal temperature variations predominantly hinge on the distance from the coastline in the direction of the sea breeze (DCDS). Moreover, during summer, the diurnal wind speed demonstrated a significant correlation with DCDS and the building coverage. Therefore, the UECM for the BMR was divided into nine distinct zones, each associated with varying degrees of recommendations for LULC and ventilation enhancement. Notably, the priority zones for heat mitigation efforts are mostly located in the central Bangkok. This study has academic implications. It has the capacity to inform and shape governmental policies and urban planning across BMR provinces. Stakeholders aim to gain a better understanding of their environmental milieu. These findings advocate future urban planning by integrating UECMs and design guidelines that consider science and policy. This approach is suitable for sustainable urban development.","2023-12-01","2024-01-19 10:23:48","2024-01-19 10:23:48","","100105","","","3","","World Development Sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Air temperature; GIS; Spatial analysis; Urban heat islands; Urban planning; Wind distributions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a geographic information system- (GIS)-based approach to evaluate the spatial heterogeneities of coastal risk—using typhoons as a case. The study employs several spatial statistics-based distributional models to systematically evaluate the geographies of typhoon risk, its spatial patterns, and statistically significant hotspots of highest risk in coastal Mainland China. Additionally, we model the level of contribution of each risk parameter (i.e., hazard, vulnerability, and community resilience) towards overall risk. The results show that among 70% coastal counties exposed to typhoons, close to 30% are in the highest risk category (value ≥ 3rd quartile). The areas under the highest risk harbor more than 50 million people (~43%)—more than 7 million non-adults (0–14 years) (~42%), and approximately 2.5 million elderly people (above 65 years) (~31%)—which is critical. The Pearl-River-Delta region of Guangdong province in southern China is identified as the hotspot of highest typhoon risk, followed by Fujian and Zhejiang provinces—95% confidence. We propose the integration of spatial statistics and distributional models in coastal risk frameworks to evaluate and map the multi-level geographies of natural hazard risk to support risk management efforts. This study is novel to foster a GIS-based approach for risk management in the coastal regions of China, particularly in a disaster-risk-reduction context.

As various high-resolution remote-sensing (RS) imaging platforms are continuously available, the remote sensing of the geological environment (GERS) provides a finegrain, all-weather, and low-cost method for identifying geological elements. Mainstream machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods can extract high-level high-dimensional semantic information and thus supply an efficient tool for high-precision classification and recognition in many fields. Therefore, the integration of advanced methods and multi-source RS images for GERS interpretation has achieved remarkable breakthroughs during the past decades. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic survey of the advances of GERS interpretation regarding ML and DL methods is still lacking. Through the collection of extensive published research in this area, this survey outlines and analyzes the challenges, progress, and promising directions of GERS interpretation. Specifically, the main challenges and difficulties in identifying GERS elements are first summarized in four aspects: sufficient element characteristics and variations, complex context disturbance, RS image quality and types, and other limitations in GERS interpretation. Second, we systematically introduce various RS imaging platforms and advanced ML and DL methods for GERS interpretation. Third, the research status and trends of several GERS applications, including their use for lithology, soil, water, rock glacier, and geological disaster, are ultimately collected and compared. Finally, potential opportunities for future research are discussed. After the systematic and comprehensive review, the conclusive findings suggest that longtime large-scale GERS interpretation and corresponding change pattern analysis will be a significant future direction to meet the needs of environment improvement and sustainable development. To complete the above goals, a fusion of satellite, airplane, environmental monitoring, geological survey, and other types of data will provide enough discriminative information, and expert knowledge, GIS, and high-performance computing techniques will be helpful to improve the efficiency and generalizability of ML and DL methods for processing the multi-platform RS data.","2023-08","2024-01-19 10:24:16","2024-01-19 10:24:16","","87-113","","","202","","","","","","","","","","English","Abd-El Monsef H, 2015, ARAB J GEOSCI, V8, P9285, DOI 10.1007/s12517-015-1909-1","","","WOS:001020425800001","","","","","","","ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION; Deep learning; Geological applications; Geological environment; GLACIER; IDENTIFICATION; LANDSAT-TM; Machine learning; NETWORK; RADAR; RANDOM FORESTS; Remote sensing; SATELLITE IMAGES; WATER INDEX NDWI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first goal (SDG 1) of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to eliminate all forms of poverty all over the world. The establishment of a scientific and effective localized SDG 1 evaluation and monitoring method is the key to achieving SDG 1. This paper proposes SDG 1 China district and county-level localization evaluation method based on multi-source remote sensing data for the United Nations Sustainable Development Framework. The temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of China's poverty areas and their SDG 1 evaluation values in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 have been analyzed. Based on the SDGs global indicator framework, this paper first constructed SDG 1 China's district and county localization indicator system and then extracted multidimensional feature factors from nighttime light images, land cover data, and digital elevation model data. Secondly, we establish SDG 1 China's localized partial least squares estimation model and SDG 1 China's localized machine learning estimation model. Finally, we analyze and verify the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of China's poverty areas and counties and their SDG 1 evaluation values. The results show that SDG 1 China's district and county localization indicator system proposed in this study and SDG 1 China's localized partial least squares estimation model can better reflect the poverty level of China's districts and counties. The estimated model R-2 is 0.65, which can identify 72.77% of China's national poverty counties. From 2012 to 2018, the spatial distribution pattern of SDG evaluation values in China's districts and counties is that the SDG evaluation values gradually increase from western China to eastern China. In addition, the average SDG 1 evaluation value of China's districts and counties increased by 23% from 2012 to 2018. This paper is oriented to the United Nations SDGs framework, explores the SDG 1 localized evaluation method of China's districts and counties based on multisource remote sensing data, and provides a scientific and rapid regional poverty monitoring and evaluation program for the implementation of the 2030 agenda poverty alleviation goals.","2022-09-08","2024-01-19 10:24:16","2024-01-19 10:37:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","Afanador NL, 2013, ANAL CHIM ACTA, V768, P49, DOI 10.1016/j.aca.2013.01.004","","","WOS:000863397100001","","","","","","","COUNTIES; DYNAMICS; INCOME POVERTY; INDICATORS; LAND-USE; machine learning; MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY; Multisource remote sensing data; partial least squares; poverty indicator system; PROVINCE; REDUCTION; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); TRACKING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, particularly for small dam reservoirs, there is a lack of consistent data on their geographical location. To address this data gap, a promising approach is to perform automated dam reservoir extraction based on globally available remote sensing imagery. It can be considered as a fine-grained task of water body extraction, which involves extracting water areas in images and then separating dam reservoirs from natural water bodies. A straightforward solution is to extend the commonly used binary-class segmentation in water body extraction to multiclass. This, however, does not work well as there exists not much pixel-level difference of water areas between dam reservoirs and natural water bodies. We propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based pipeline that decomposes dam reservoir extraction into water body segmentation and dam reservoir recognition. Water bodies are first separated from background lands in a segmentation model and each individual water body is then predicted as either dam reservoir or natural water body in a classification model. For the former step, point-level metric learning (PLML) with triplets across images is injected into the segmentation model to address contour ambiguities between water areas and land regions. For the latter step, prior-guided metric learning (PGML) with triplets from clusters is injected into the classification model to optimize the image embedding space in a fine-grained level based on reservoir clusters. To facilitate future research, we establish a benchmark dataset with Earth imagery data and human-labeled reservoirs from river basins in West Africa and India. Extensive experiments were conducted on this benchmark in the water body segmentation task, dam reservoir recognition task, and the joint dam reservoir extraction task. Superior performance has been observed in the respective tasks when comparing our method with state-of-the-art approaches.

The recent massive wildfires, which hit Australia during the 2019-2020 summer season, raised questions to what extent the risk of wildfires can be linked to various climate, environmental, topographical, and social factors and how to predict fire occurrences to take preventive measures. Hence, the main objective of this study was to develop an automatized and cloud-based workflow for generating a training dataset of fire events at a continental level using freely available remote sensing data with a reasonable computational expense for injecting into machine learning models. As a result, a data-driven model was set up in Google Earth Engine platform, which is publicly accessible and open for further adjustments. The training dataset was applied to different machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Classification and Regression Tree. The findings show that Random Forest outperformed other algorithms and hence it was used further to explore the driving factors using variable importance analysis. The study indicates the probability of fire occurrences across Australia as well as identifies the potential driving factors of Australian wildfires for the 2019-2020 summer season. The methodical approach and achieved results and drawn conclusions can be of great importance to policymakers, environmentalists, and climate change researchers, among others.","2021-01","2024-01-19 10:24:17","2024-01-19 10:45:10","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","English","Abatzoglou JT, 2018, SCI DATA, V5, DOI 10.1038/sdata.2017.191","","","WOS:000606058700001","","","","","","","AUSTRALIA; Classification and Regression Tree; FIRE OCCURRENCE; fire severity; FIREFIGHTING; FOREST fires; Google Earth Engine; machine learning; MACHINE learning; Naive Bayes; Naïve Bayes; random forest; RANDOM forest algorithms; REGRESSION trees; remote sensing; SUMMER; SUSCEPTIBILITY; Sustainable Development Goals; WILDFIRE prevention; wildfires; WILDFIRES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Farmers do not currently have a standardized, accurate method of detecting the presence, abundance, and locations of rodents in their fields, and hence do not have environmentally efficient methods of rodent control able to promote sustainable agriculture oriented to reduce the environmental impacts of cultivation. New developments in unmanned aerial system (UAS) platforms and sensor technology facilitate cost-effective data collection through simultaneous multimodal data collection approaches at very high spatial resolutions in environmental and agricultural contexts. Object detection from remote-sensing images has been an active research topic over the last decade. With recent increases in computational resources and data availability, deep learning-based object detection methods are beginning to play an important role in advancing remote-sensing commercial and scientific applications. However, the performance of current detectors on various UAS-based datasets, including multimodal spatial and physical datasets, remains limited in terms of small object detection. In particular, the ability to quickly detect small objects from a large observed scene (at field scale) is still an open question. In this paper, we compare the efficiencies of applying one- and two-stage detector models to a single UAS-based image and a processed (via Pix4D mapper photogrammetric program) UAS-based orthophoto product to detect rodent burrows, for agriculture/environmental applications as to support farmer activities in the achievements of SDG2. Our results indicate that the use of multimodal data from low-cost UASs within a self-training YOLOv3 model can provide relatively accurate and robust detection for small objects (mAP of 0.86 and an F1-score of 93.39%), and can deliver valuable insights for field management with high spatial precision able to reduce the environmental costs of crop production in the direction of precision agriculture management.","2021-08","2024-01-19 10:24:18","2024-01-19 10:46:25","","","","16","13","","","","","","","","","","English","Al-Najjar HAH, 2019, REMOTE SENS-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/rs11121461","","","WOS:000690270800001","","","","","","","AGRICULTURE; BIOLOGY; CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS; DIGITAL photogrammetry; EfficientNet; Faster R-CNN; ISRAEL; LEVANT VOLE; MACHINE learning; MICROTUS-GUENTHERI; OBJECT recognition (Computer vision); PRECISION farming; RATS; REMOTE sensing; REMOTE-sensing images; RetinaNet; small object detection; SUSTAINABLE agriculture; UAS; UNITED Nations; YOLOv3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper is aimed to develop a prediction model for mapping LULC using multi-spectral satellite images, which were captured at a spatial resolution of 3 m by a 4-band PlanetScope satellite. The dataset used in the study includes 105 geo-referenced images categorized into 8 LULC different classes. To train this model on both raster and vector data, various machine learning strategies such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees (DTs), Random Forests (RFs), Normal Bayes (NB), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were employed. A set of metrics including precision, recall, F-score, and kappa index are utilized to measure the accuracy of the model. Empirical experiments were conducted, and the results show that the ANN achieved a classification accuracy of 97.1%. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to monitor land changes in Egypt that were conducted on high-resolution images with 3 m of spatial resolution.

Timely management and monitoring of soil salinity are essential to achieve the most sustainable development goals in arid and semi-arid regions. It has been demonstrated that Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data have a high sensitivity to the soil dielectric constant and soil surface roughness, thus having great potential for the detection of soil salinity. However, studies combining PALSAR-2 data and Landsat 8 data to invert soil salinity information are less common. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is characterized by simple operation, fast computation, and good adaptability, but there are relatively few studies applying it to soil salinity as well. This paper takes the Keriya Oasis as an example, proposing the PSO-SVR and PSO-BPNN models by combining PSO with support vector machine regression (SVR) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) models. Then, PALSAR-2 data, Landsat 8 data, evapotranspiration data, groundwater burial depth data, and DEM data were combined to conduct the inversion study of soil salinity in the study area. The results showed that the introduction of PSO generated a satisfactory estimating performance. The SVR model accuracy (R-2) improved by 0.07 (PALSAR-2 data), 0.20 (Landsat 8 data), and 0.19 (PALSAR + Landsat data); the BP model accuracy (R-2) improved by 0.03 (PALSAR-2 data), 0.24 (Landsat 8 data), and 0.12 (PALSAR + Landsat data), and then combined with the model inversion plots, we found that PALSAR + Landsat data combined with the PSO-SVR model could achieve better inversion results. The fine texture information of PALSAR-2 data can be used to better invert the soil salinity in the study area by combining it with the rich spectral information of Landsat 8 data. This study complements the research ideas and methods for soil salinization using multi-source remote sensing data to provide scientific support for salinity monitoring in the study area.","2022-02","2024-01-19 10:24:18","2024-01-19 10:52:42","","","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","English","Abuelgasim A, 2019, REMOTE SENS APPL, V13, P415, DOI 10.1016/j.rsase.2018.12.010","","","WOS:000756081800001","","","","","","","ALGORITHMS; back-propagation neural network; IRRIGATION; LANDSAT satellites; MACHINE learning; MOISTURE; OASES; OPTIMIZATION; PALSAR; particle swarm optimization; PREDICTION; PROVINCE; REGRESSION; REMOTE sensing; SALINIZATION; SCALE; SOIL salinity; soil salinization; SOIL salinization; support vector regression; SYNTHETIC aperture radar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Population growth and urbanization result in negative consequences on the environment. Such land has experienced various environmental issues due to rapid urbanization and population increases. Such expansion in urbanization has a big impact on worsening the residences soon and in the long term, as the population is projected to increase more and more. One such issue is the urban heat island (UHI), which is computed based on land surface temperature (LST). The UHI effect has fundamental anthropogenic impacts on local areas, particularly in rapidly growing cities. This is due to the unplanned shifts in land use and land cover (LUALC) at the local level, which results in climate condition variations. Therefore, proper planning based on concrete information is the best policy in the long run to remedy these issues. In this study, we attempt to map out UHI phenomena using machine learning (ML) algorithms, including bagging and random subspace. The proposed research also fulfills the sustainable development goals (SDGs) requirement. We exploit the correlation and regression methods to understand the relationship between biophysical composition and the UHI effect. Our findings indicate that in the megacity of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from 2000 to 2021, the urban area enlarged by about 80%, while the UHI increased overall. Impervious surfaces significantly impact the UHI effect, while vegetation and water bodies have negative implications for the UHI effect. More than 80% of the total parts in Jeddah have been classified by extremely high UHI conditions, as determined by the bagging and random subspace models. In particular, the megacity's south, north, and central-east parts were categorized by very high UHI conditions. This research is not only expected to assist in understanding the spatial patterns of the UHI in Jeddah, but to assist planners and policymakers in spatial planning. It will help to ensure sustainable urban management and improve life quality.","2023-06","2024-01-19 10:24:18","2024-01-19 10:24:18","","","","6","12","","","","","","","","","","English","Abdulla-Al Kafy, 2021, APPL GEOMAT, V13, P793, DOI 10.1007/s12518-021-00390-3","","","WOS:001014972500001","","","","","","","AREA; CITIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONFIGURATION; energy and building; GREEN; land surface temperature (LST); land use and land cover (LUALC); LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; machine learning; PATTERN; RANDOM SUBSPACE METHOD; remote sensing; urban heat island effect; urbanization; URBANIZATION; USE/LAND COVER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Non-parametric machine learning methods were used to analyze the linkage between agriculture and poverty at the global scale, including the classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest models. We found that the yield gap, fertilizer consumption and potential cropland ratio in protected areas correlated with poverty. Developing countries usually had a ratio of actual to potential yield less than 0.33 and fertilizer consumption less than 7.31 kg/ha.

With freely available satellite data archives and cloud computing resources, it is now more accessible to conduct such large-scale monitoring and assessment. Yet, few studies examine the reproducibility of such mangrove monitoring frameworks, especially in terms of generating consistent spatial extent. Our objective was to evaluate a combination of image processing approaches to classify mangrove forests along the coast of Senegal and The Gambia. We used freely available global satellite data (Sentinel-2), and cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine) to run two machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART). We calibrated and validated the algorithms using 800 reference points collected using high-resolution images. We further re-ran 10 iterations for each algorithm, utilizing unique subsets of the initial training data. While all iterations resulted in thematic mangrove maps with over 90% accuracy, the mangrove extent ranges between 827-2807 km(2) for Senegal and 245-1271 km(2) for The Gambia with one outlier for each country. We further report ""Places of Agreement"" (PoA) to identify areas where all iterations for both methods agree (506.6 km(2) and 129.6 km(2) for Senegal and The Gambia, respectively), thus have a high confidence in predicting mangrove extent. While we acknowledge the time- and cost-effectiveness of such methods for the landscape managers, we recommend utilizing them with utmost caution, as well as post-classification on-the-ground checks, especially for decision making.","2019-12-02","2024-01-19 10:24:18","2024-01-19 10:24:18","","","","24","11","","","","","","","","","","English","Abbas S, 2011, INT ARCH PHOTOGRAMM, V38-8, P187","","","WOS:000507333400044","","","","","","","Africa; ALOS PALSAR; BIOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS; CART; CLASSIFICATION; DYNAMICS; EARTH-OBSERVATION; FOREST COVER; google earth engine; LAND-COVER CHANGE; machine-learning algorithms; mangrove; MULTITEMPORAL SATELLITE DATA; random forest; REMOTE; Senegal; SUNDARBANS; The Gambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The plants' phenological variables, derived from time series satellite data, can be monitored and the changes in satellite imagery may be used to identify the beginning, peak, and end of the growing season. This study investigated the use of remote sensing data and land surface phenology (LSP) parameters to evaluate the impacts of fire. The LSP parameters included the start of growing season (SOS), the length of the growing season (LOS), the end of the growing season (EOS), maximum greenness of the season (Gmax), and minimum greenery in the season (Gmin) in the fire-impacted, semiarid oak forests of Iran. These LSP parameters were extracted from multitemporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) data, acquired from MODIS sensor images in Zagros of the Ilam province in western Iran. By extracting LSP indices from the NDVI and EVI2 data, the indices were compared between burned forest areas, areas surrounding the burned forests, and unburned areas and for timesteps representing pre-fire, fire (i.e., year of fire), and post-fire (i.e., 2 years) conditions. It was found that for the burned area, there were significant differences in Gmax and the day that Gmax occurred. Furthermore, there was also a significant difference in Gmin between the pre- and post-fire conditions when NDVI was used and a significant difference between Gmax when EVI2 was used. The results also showed that in both time series there was a significant difference between the burned and control area in terms of Gmax. In general, the results showed that the fire had a negative effect on LSP, but in the two years after the fire, there were signs of forest restoration. This study provides necessary information to inform forest and resource conservation and restoration programs.","2023-03","2024-01-19 10:21:52","2024-01-19 10:30:04","","","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","English","Banti MA, 2019, J LAND USE SCI, V14, P21, DOI 10.1080/1747423X.2019.1614687","","","WOS:000956073500001","","","","","","","BRANTII LINDL.

Several countries have recently launched hyperspectral remote sensing satellites, opening new av-enues for accurate soil-salinity monitoring. Among them, Gaofen-5 (GF-5) from China has a high comprehensive performance, including a spectral resolution of 5 nm, 330 bands, and signal-to-noise ratio of 700. However, the potential of GF-5 for estimating soil salinity is not well understood. In this study, we proposed a strategy that includes bootstrap methods, fractional order derivative (FOD) techniques and decision-level fusion models to exploit the soil salinity diagnostic information and reduce estimation uncertainty in the Ebinur Lake oasis in northwestern China. The results showed that the GF-5 data were suitable for assessing soil salinity. The FOD technique enhanced the correlation between soil salinity and spectra, identified more diagnostic bands, improved the accuracy of soil salinity estimation, and reduced model uncertainty. The low-order FOD outperformed the high-order FOD. The spectra processed by the 0.9 order derivative were the most correlated with soil salinity (r =-0.76). The model driven by the 0.8 order derivative produced the optimal estimated model (R2 = 0.95, root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.20 dS m-1 and a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) = 5.96). The model driven by the 0.8 order derivative had less uncertainty than the models based on the original and integer-order derivative (first-and second-derivatives) spectra. This study provides a reference for estimating soil salinity from GF-5 data using the proposed framework with low uncertainty and high accuracy. GF-5 data have great potential for assessing environmental problems and facilitating further SDGs.","2022-08","2024-01-19 10:23:26","2024-01-19 10:45:15","","","","","112","","","","","","","","","","English","Abedi F, 2021, LAND DEGRAD DEV, V32, P1540, DOI 10.1002/ldr.3811","","","WOS:000844161000003","","","","","","","Digital soil mapping; Fractional order derivative; Gaofen-5; Machine learning; MSI; OLI; ORGANIC-MATTER CONTENT; PREDICTION; REGION; Soil salinization; UNCERTAINTY; WATER; YELLOW-RIVER DELTA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the limited availability of training labels poses a challenge in developing supervised methods to accurately delineate field boundaries using Earth observation (EO) data. This letter introduces an open dataset for training and benchmarking machine learning methods to delineate agricultural field boundaries in polygon format. The large-scale dataset consists of 439 001 field polygons divided into 62 tiles of approximately 5 x 5 km distributed across Vietnam and Cambodia, covering a range of fields and diverse landscape types. The field polygons have been meticulously digitized from satellite images, following a rigorous multistep quality control process and topological consistency checks.

This requires automated analysis of approximately 1 551 997 km(2) area within the ""Brick-Kiln-Belt"" of South Asia. Although modern machine learning techniques have achieved high accuracy for a wide variety of applications, problems involving large-scale analysis using high-resolution satellite imagery requires both accuracy as well as computational efficiency. We propose a coarse-to-fine strategy consisting of an inexpensive classifier and a detector, which work in tandem to achieve high accuracy at low computational cost. More specifically, we propose a two-stage gated neural network architecture called Kiln-Net. At the first stage, imagery is classified using the ResNet-152 modelwhich filters out over99% of irrelevant data. At the second stage, a YOLOv3-based object detector is applied to find the precise location of each brick kiln in the candidate regions. The dataset, named Asia14, consisting of 14 000 Digital Globe RGB images and 14 categories is also developed to train the proposed kiln-net architecture. Ourproposed network architecture is evaluated on approximately 3,300 km(2) region ( 337 723 image patches) from 14 different cities in five different countries of South Asia. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods employed for the recognition of brick kilns and achieved an accuracy of 99.96% and average F1 score of 0.91. To the best of our knowledge, it is also 20 x faster than existing methods.","2020","2024-01-19 10:21:39","2024-01-19 10:53:59","","3251-3262","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","Alganci U, 2020, REMOTE SENS-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/rs12030458","","","WOS:000543958200001","","","","","","","Brick Kiln; NDVI; ResNet-152; sustainable development goals; you only look once (YOLO)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent advances in very high-resolution satellite sensor systems (i.e., WorldView-3), computing power, and machine learning (ML) have provided improved mapping of fine-scale changes in the tropics. However, approaches so far focused on feature extraction or the extensive tuning of ML parameters, hindering the potential of ML in forest conservation mapping by not using textural information, which is found to be powerful for many applications. Additionally, the contribution of shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands in forest cover mapping is unknown. The objectives were to develop end-to-end mapping of the tropical forest using fully convolution neural networks (FCNNs) with WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery and to evaluate human impact on the environment using the Betampona Nature Reserve (BNR) in Madagascar as the test site. FCNN (U-Net) using spatial/textural information was implemented and compared with feature-fed pixel-based methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Results show that the FCNN model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 90.9%, while SVM, RF, and DNN provided accuracies of 88.6%, 84.8%, and 86.6%, respectively. When SWIR bands were excluded from the input data, FCNN provided superior performance over other methods with a 1.87% decrease in accuracy, while the accuracies of other models-SVM, RF, and DNN-decreased by 5.42%, 3.18%, and 8.55%, respectively. Spatial-temporal analysis showed a 0.7% increase in Evergreen Forest within the BNR and a 32% increase in tree cover within residential areas likely due to forest regeneration and conservation efforts.

The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve. We propose a novel model integrating an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and CA for optimizing parameters of variables in the urban growth model and make a comparison between AFSA-CA and other five models, which is used to study a 40-year urban land growth of Wuhan. We found that the urban growth types from 1995 to 2015 appeared relatively consistent, mainly including infilling, edge-expansion and distant-leap types in Wuhan, which a certain range of urban land growth on the periphery of the central area. Additionally, although the genetic algorithms (GA)-CA model and the AFSA-CA model among the six models due to the distance variables, the parameter value of the GA-CA model is -15.5409 according to the fact that the population (POP) variable should be positively. As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models. Finally, it is projected that the potentials of urban growth in Wuhan for 2025 and 2035 under three scenarios (natural urban land growth without any restrictions (NULG), sustainable urban land growth with cropland protection and ecological security (SULG), and economic urban land growth with sustainable development and economic development in the core area (EULG)) focus mainly on existing urban land and some new town centers based on AFSA-CA urban growth simulation model.

In  this study, Sentinel-2 (multispectral data) and ZY-1 02D (hyperspectral data)  were used together with 15709 gridded yield data (with a resolution of 5 m × 5 m)  to predict the winter wheat yield. These estimates were based on four mainstream  data-driven approaches: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF),  Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The  method that gave the best estimate of the winter wheat yield was determined, and  the accuracy of the estimates based on multispectral and hyperspectral data were  compared. The results showed that the LSTM model, for which the RMSE of the  estimates was 0.201 t/ha, performed better than the RF (RMSE = 0.260 t/ha), GBDT  (RMSE = 0.306 t/ha), and SVR (RMSE = 0.489 t/ha) methods. The estimates based on  the ZY-1 02D hyperspectral data were more accurate than those based on the 30-m  Sentinel-2 data: RMSE = 0.237 t/ha for the ZY-1 02D data, which is about a 5%  improvement on the RSME of 0.307 t/ha for the 30-m Sentinel-2 data. However, the  10-m Sentinel-2 data performed even better, giving an RMSE of 0.219 t/ha. In  addition, it was found that the greenness vegetation index SR (simple ratio  index) outperformed the traditional vegetation indices. The results highlight the  potential of the shortwave infrared bands to replace the visible and  near-infrared bands for predicting crop yields Our study demonstrates the  advantages of the deep learning method LSTM over machine learning methods in  terms of its ability to make accurate estimates of the winter wheat yield.","2022","2024-01-19 10:24:44","2024-01-19 11:00:58","","1090970","","","13","","Front Plant Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Cheng, Zhang, Peng, Zhong, Yu, Liu, Xiao, Li, Li, Chen, Ye, Wang, Yu, Hu and Yang.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36618627  PMCID: PMC9816798","","","","band selection; deep learning; google earth engine (GEE); hyperspectral; winter wheat; yield estimation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly relevant for the frequent monitoring  required to assess progress towards the UNs' Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs). The Sundarban Biosphere Reserve (SBR) is a region of international  ecological importance, containing the Indian portion of the world's largest  mangrove forest. The region is densely populated and home to over 4.4 million  people, many living in chronic poverty with a strong dependence on nature-based  rural livelihoods. Such livelihoods are vulnerable to frequent natural hazards  including cyclone landfall and storm surges. In this study we examine  associations between environmental variables derived from EO and geospatial data  with a village level multidimensional poverty metric using random forest machine  learning, to provide evidence in support of policy formulation in the field of  poverty reduction. We find that environmental variables can predict up to 78% of  the relative distribution of the poorest villages within the SBR. Exposure to  cyclone hazard was the most important variable for prediction of poverty. The  poorest villages were associated with relatively small areas of rural settlement  (<∼30%), large areas of agricultural land (>∼50%) and moderate to high cyclone  hazard. The poorest villages were also associated with less productive  agricultural land than the wealthiest. Analysis suggests villages with access to  more diverse livelihood options, and a smaller dependence on agriculture may be  more resilient to cyclone hazard. This study contributes to the understanding of  poverty-environment dynamics within Low-and middle-income countries and the  associations found can inform policy linked to socio-environmental scenarios  within the SBR and potentially support monitoring of work towards SDG1 (No  Poverty) across the region.","2022-07-01","2024-01-19 10:24:44","2024-01-19 10:43:02","","114950","","","313","","J Environ Manage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Dust storms blown from the dried lakebed have  created serious environmental hazards in adjacent areas. These crises would  jeopardise achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and  emphasise the need for evaluating the spatial distribution of soil enrichment of  potentially toxic elements (PTEs) (As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn). Conventional  assessment would require a costly sampling method to map potentially polluted  areas. Digital soil mapping (DSM) has proved to be a cost-efficient method for  soil mapping, however its application in mapping enrichment of PTEs in soil is  still lacking. This study aims to map and project the potential pollution of PTEs  in the Urmia Lake area using digital mapping techniques and Landsat-8 OLI  satellite images. A total of 129 surficial soil samples were collected as ground  control. Enrichment factors (EFs) of PTEs and the Modified Pollution Index (MPI)  were spatially predicted using two machine learning models. Covariates were  derived from a suite of Landsat-8 spectral indices. The bootstrapping method was  used to analyse the uncertainties. The results showed that Random Forests  performed well in estimating EFs of several PTEs. Spectral indices using NIR and  SWIR bands were key to predict these PTEs and MPI. The digital maps demonstrated  that the study area was enriched with As, Cu and Pb at moderate to significant  levels. Regions under the lower ecological level (elevation <-1274 m) had  significantly larger enrichment than those of higher elevation. Based on MPI, 43%  of the area was categorised as moderately polluted, and 31% of the area was  moderately-heavily polluted. Possible sources of PTEs were discharges from  farmlands, landfills, and industries. Our results revealed that the Urmia Lake  desiccating has caused severe environmental challenges and needs immediate  restoration.","2022-02-20","2024-01-19 10:24:44","2024-01-19 10:42:21","","152086","","","808","","Sci Total Environ","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Passive microwave remote sensing has been proven to be an efficient method to detect SD at regional or global scales. However, numerous heterogeneous snow property parameters and forest parameters affect the microwave radiation characteristics, which is a great challenge for SD retrieval. In this study, a novel SD retrieval algorithm that comprehensively considered the multiple sensitive factors was developed at global scales by coupling the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) model and machine learning (ML) technique. The exponential correlation length (Pec), snow density (ρ), and forest cover fraction (fforest) are three sensitive parameters for retrieving SD from passive microwave observations based on the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) algorithm. The key parameter Pec, which characterizes the snow microstructure information inside snowpacks, was optimized by minimizing the brightness temperature between satellite observations and microwave radiative transfer model simulations by integrating the MEMLS, forest impact, and atmospheric radiation attenuation. The random forest (RF) ML technique was used, and the optimal combination of independent variables was selected by correlation heatmap and importance ranking of variables. Six selected essential parameters, including Pec, vertical polarized brightness temperature differences between 18.7 and 36.5 GHz, ρ from ERA5, fforest, elevation, and longitude together with target SD output were used to train the RF model. Seventy percent of the entire data at meteorological stations were randomly chosen to train the RF model, and the remaining 30% were adopted as the validation data from 2013 to 2020 to ensure the mutual independence of training data and validation data. Compared with independent in situ measurements, the overall RMSE of SD is 13.6 cm, which was noticeably lower than those of the international SD remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets, including AMSR2 (36.2 cm), GlobSnow 3.0 (25.3 cm), ERA5 (38.2 cm), and ERA5-land (29.9 cm). The results demonstrated that the new proposed algorithm, by coupling the MEMLS model with the ML technique, could significantly enhance the overall performance in SD retrieval at global scales.","2023-09-01","2024-01-19 11:01:23","2024-01-19 11:10:18","2024-01-19 11:01:23","113712","","","295","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/CAJQH65Z/S0034425723002638.html","","ATMOSPHERIC radiation; BRIGHTNESS temperature; Global sensitivity analysis; MACHINE learning; MEMLS model; MICROWAVE remote sensing; Passive microwave remote sensing; SNOW accumulation; SNOW cover; Snow depth; Snow microstructure; SNOWMELT","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we propose a long-term steady-state N balance (SSNB) approach without these complications that is suitable for sustainable smallholder farming. The hypothesis underpinning the concept of SSNB is that an intensively cultivated soil–crop system with excessive N inputs and high N losses can be transformed into a steadystate system with minimal losses while maintaining high yields. Based on SSNB, we estimate the optimized N application range across 3,824 crop counties for the three staple crops in China. We evaluated SSNB first in ca. 18,000 researcher-managed on-farm trials followed by testing in on-farm trials with 13,760 smallholders who applied SSNB-optimized N rates under the guidance of local extension staff. Results showed that SSNB could significantly reduce N fertilizer use by 21 to 28%while maintaining or increasing yields by 6 to 7%, compared to current smallholder practices.

Such phenology signals importantly regulate large-scale biogeochemical cycles and regional climate. PlanetScope CubeSats data with a 3-m resolution and near-daily global coverage provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor both fine- and ecosystem-scale phenology variability along large environmental gradients. However, a scalable method that accurately characterizes leaf phenology from PlanetScope with biophysically meaningful metrics remains lacking. We developed an index-guided, ecologically constrained autoencoder (IG-ECAE) method to automatically derive a deciduousness metric (percentage of upper tree canopies with leaf-off status within an image pixel) from PlanetScope. The IG-ECAE first estimated the reflectance spectra of leafy/leafless canopies based on their spectral indices characteristics, then used the derived reflectance spectra to guide an autoencoder deep learning method with additional ecological constraints to refine the reflectance spectra, and finally used linear spectral unmixing to estimate the relative abundance of leafless canopies (or deciduousness) per PlanetScope image pixel. We tested the IG-ECAE method at 16 tropical forest sites spanning multiple continents and a large precipitation gradient (1470–2819 mm year−1). Among these sites, we evaluated the PlanetScope-derived deciduousness against corresponding measures derived from WorldView-2 (n = 9 sites) and local phenocams (n = 9 sites). Our results show that PlanetScope-derived deciduousness agrees: 1) with that derived from WorldView-2 at the patch level (90 m × 90 m) with r2 = 0.89 across all sites; and 2) with that derived from phenocams to quantify ecosystem-scale seasonality with r2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.96. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of IG-ECAE in characterizing the wide variability in deciduousness across scales from pixels to forest ecosystems, and from a single date to the full annual cycle, indicating the potential for using high-resolution satellites to track the large-scale phenological patterns and response of tropical forests to climate change.","2023-03-01","2024-01-19 11:03:11","2024-01-19 11:10:31","2024-01-19 11:03:10","113429","","","286","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/CGRMFFIX/S0034425722005351.html","","BIOGEOCHEMICAL cycles; Carbon cycles; Deciduousness; DEEP learning; Environmental gradient; FOREST microclimatology; Machine learning; Multi-scale remote sensing; PHENOLOGY; PLANT phenology; TROPICAL climate; Tropical forests; TROPICAL forests","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Developing efficient ways of determining the properties of informal settlements (when, where, and who) is critical for upgrading services and planning. Remote sensing data are increasingly used to understand built environments. In this study, we combine two sources of data, very-high-resolution imagery and time-series Landsat data, to identify and describe informal settlements. The indicators characterising informal settlements were grouped into four different spatial and temporal levels: environment, settlement, object and time. These indicators were then used in an object-based machine learning (ML) workflow to identify informal settlements. The proposed method had a 95% overall accuracy at mapping informal settlements. Among the spatial and temporal levels examined, the contribution of the settlement level indicators was most significant in the ML model, followed by the object-level indicators. Whilst the temporal level did not contribute greatly to the classification of informal settlements, it provided a way of understanding when the settlements were formed. The adaptation of this method would allow the combination of a wide-ranging and diverse group of indicators in a comprehensive ML framework.","2022-01","2024-01-19 11:04:11","2024-01-19 11:10:34","2024-01-19 11:04:11","1226","","5","14","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 5 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","; ; /Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/I726P79Y/Fallatah et al. - 2022 - Combining Object-Based Machine Learning with Long-.pdf","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/ZGfGM?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=VYCRpICtQpQH%2Fs6L0cn9BiYbNpk%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Combining+Object-Based+Machine+Learning+with+Long-Term+Time-Series+Analysis+for+Informal+Settlement+Identification&title=Remote+Sensing&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=14&issue=5&spage=1226&au=Fallatah%2C+Ahmad%3BJones%2C+Simon%3BWallace%2C+Luke%3BMitchell%2C+David&isbn=&jtitle=Remote+Sensing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Frs14051226","Algorithms; Archives & records; BUILT environment; CLASSIFICATION; DETECTING TRENDS; Developing countries--LDCs; ENSEMBLE; FOREST DISTURBANCE; Geography; Ghettos; GIS; Image resolution; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; Informal housing; informal settlement indicators; LAND; Landsat; LANDSAT satellites; Learning algorithms; Level indicators; Machine learning; MACHINE learning; machine learning (ML); MACHINE theory; Mapping; object-based image analysis (OBIA); Ontology; Physics; Planning; Population growth; Poverty; Remote sensing; REMOTE sensing; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; Satellite imagery; Settlement; Sustainable development; sustainable development goals (SDGs); TEXTURE; Time series; TIME series analysis; time-series analysis; Urban areas; Urban environments; URBAN-GROWTH; urbanisation; very-high-resolution (VHR); Workflow","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is designed to overcome some limitations in existing Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) inversion methods, including the high dimensionality of the inverse problem, the convergence problem due to possible equifinality, and the dependence of some RTM variables on the crop-specific architecture. The PROSAIL model is first inverted in a calibration step using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm over a global dataset of ground GAI measurements (for maize, wheat, and rice) and the corresponding reflectance observations from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Quickbird to derive crop-specific distributions of PROSAIL input variables. These distributions were then used as prior information to predict GAI over an independent set of reflectance observations. Results show that the full Bayesian approach provides close estimates of GAI to ground truth, with respective Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.01, 1.33, and 0.97 for maize, wheat, and rice (R2=0.67, 0.76 and 0.63, respectively). The performances are better than those approaches generally reported using radiative transfer models that are non-crop-specific, like the SNAP algorithm for Sentinel-2, but are slightly behind the purely empirical models based on machine learning. However, the proposed approach provides an explicit insight of the joint distribution of PROSAIL variables that are valid for any satellite platform. This constitutes a major advantage against purely empirical models, as it enables to fully exploit large observational datasets from multiple sensors and generalize to other platforms.","2022-09-01","2024-01-19 11:04:38","2024-01-19 11:10:41","2024-01-19 11:04:37","113085","","","278","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/ULUM6DKP/S0034425722001997.html","","ANN; Bayesian; CROPS; Green Area Index (GAI); INVERSE problems; Landsat-8; PROSAIL; RADIATIVE transfer; Sentinel-2; STANDARD deviations","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Timely and accurate crop information for NCP is very important to China's food security and sustainable development. Due to high variability of the temporal profiles of vegetation indices, classification models using temporally aggregated remote sensing data often exhibit suboptimal performance for multi-crop classification in the NCP with complex cropping patterns. Therefore, optimal feature sets and classification models should be developed for efficient and accurate crop mapping in this region. In this study, we used all available Sentinel-2 imagery in 2020 to map major crops including winter wheat/corn, cotton, peanut, and millet in a typical winter wheat production city in the central part of the NCP. NDVI time series, textural, and phenological features from Sentinel-2 time series and topographic features of the study area were derived as input features (394 features in total). Two feature selection methods, random forest and unsupervised feature selection based on multi-subspace randomization and collaboration (SRCFS), were used to select 20 informative features from the 394 features. Then, four groups of features were evaluated with three machine learning classifiers, i.e., random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). The results showed that the most useful features for crop type classification for the region were phenological and textural features during February to March and April to May. When using the full feature set, RF provided the best results compared with SVM and ANN. However, both RF and SVM classifier with 20 RF-selected features generated the optimal results. The crops were identified with an overall accuracy of 93% and a kappa coefficient of 0.9 in the final 10-meter resolution crop map. The feature selection and machine learning classification methods can be applied to high-resolution crop mapping using time series of Sentinel-2 data in agricultural regions with mixed cropping patterns in an efficient manner.","2023-02-01","2024-01-19 11:05:16","2024-01-19 11:10:47","2024-01-19 11:05:16","107577","","","205","","Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/BBTUI82R/S0168169922008857.html","","AGRICULTURE; CHINA; CLASSIFICATION; COUNTY; Crop mapping; CROPS; Feature selection; FEATURE selection; FEATURES; FORESTS; LAND-COVER; LANDSCAPE; Machine learning; MACHINE learning; PEANUTS; PERFORMANCE; PHENOLOGY; RED-EDGE BANDS; Sentinel-2 time series; TEXTURE; TIME series analysis","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Developing a scientific and feasible method for monitoring and evaluating local poverty is important for the implementation of the SDG agenda. Based on the 2030 United Nations SDGs, in this paper, a quantitative evaluation model is built and applied to all poverty-stricken counties in Hunan Province. First, based on the SDG global index framework and local index system of China, a local SDG index system for poverty-related goals is designed, and the weights of the indexes are derived using an entropy method. The scores obtained for counties and districts with data available are then taken as the true value for the poverty assessment. Second, using National Polar-orbiting Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) nighttime light images and land use and digital elevation model data, six factors, including socioeconomic, land cover, terrain and traffic factors, are extracted. Third, we then construct multiple linear evaluation models of poverty targets defined by the SDGs and machine learning evaluation models, including regression trees, support vector machines, Gaussian process regressions and ensemble trees. Last, combined with statistical data of poverty-stricken counties in Hunan Province, model validation and accuracy evaluation are carried out. The results show that the R2 and relative error of the localized, multiple linear evaluation model, including all six factors, are 0.76 and 19.12%, respectively. The poverty-stricken counties in Hunan Province were spatially aggregated and distributed mainly in the southeastern and northwestern regions. The proposed method for regional poverty assessment based on multisource geographic data provides an effective poverty monitoring reference scheme for the implementation of the poverty eradication goals in the 2030 agenda.","2021-01","2024-01-19 11:05:33","2024-01-19 11:10:51","2024-01-19 11:05:33","4778","","23","13","","","Evaluation and Analysis of Poverty-Stricken Counties under the Framework of the UN Sustainable Development Goals","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 23 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/9BSGW6AT/Wang et al. - 2021 - Evaluation and Analysis of Poverty-Stricken Counti.pdf","","CITY; DIGITAL elevation models; GAUSSIAN processes; HUNAN Sheng (China); INCOME POVERTY; INDEX; INDICATORS; INFRARED imaging; KRIGING; LAND-USE; machine learning; multiple linear regression model; multisource geographic data; POLITICS; POOR; poverty index system; REGRESSION trees; SDGS; SUPPORT vector machines; sustainable development goals; SUSTAINABLE Development Goals (United Nations); TRACKING; UNITED Nations","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study is to create an urban quality of life index map for Al Ain city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The research aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals number ten (reduce inequalities) and eleven (sustainable cities and communities). In this study, remote sensing images and GIS vector datasets were used to extract biophysical and infrastructure facility indicators. The biophysical indicators are normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), enhanced normalized difference impervious surfaces index (ENDISI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), land surface temperature (LST), slope, and land use land cover (LULC). In addition, infrastructure facility indicators such as distances to main roads, parks, schools, and hospitals were obtained. Additional infrastructure facility variables namely built-up to green area and build-up to bare soil area ratio were extracted from the LULC map. Machine learning was used to classify satellite images and generate LULC map. Random Forest (RF) was found as the best machine learning classifier for this study. The overall classification and Kappa hat accuracy was 95.3 and 0.92, respectively. Both biophysical and infrastructure facility indicators were integrated using principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA analysis identified four components that explain 75% of the variance among the indicators. The four factors were interpreted as the effect of LULC, infrastructure facility, ecological, and slope. Finally, the components were assigned weights based on the percentage of variance they explained and developed the UQoL map. Overall, the result showed that greenness has a greater effect on the spatial pattern of UQoL in Al Ain city. The study could be of a value to policy makers in urban planning and socioeconomic departments.","2022-09","2024-01-19 11:06:27","2024-01-19 11:10:55","2024-01-19 11:06:27","458","","9","11","","","Extraction of Urban Quality of Life Indicators Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 9 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","; ; /Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/6Y97RD9T/Yagoub et al. - 2022 - Extraction of Urban Quality of Life Indicators Usi.pdf","https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/PFT/1/LdBGO?_a=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%2BgIBWYIDA1dlYooDHENJRDoyMDI0MDExNjA4MTUyNTcwOTo0MDI5NzY%3D&_s=6yz8UB9JHE92G1cLEV%2FhMttWEcQ%3D; http://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/openurl/UBL/UBL_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apubliccontent&atitle=Extraction+of+Urban+Quality+of+Life+Indicators+Using+Remote+Sensing+and+Machine+Learning%3A+The+Case+of+Al+Ain+City%2C+United+Arab+Emirates+%28UAE%29&title=ISPRS+International+Journal+of+Geo-Information&issn=&date=2022-01-01&volume=11&issue=9&spage=458&au=Yagoub%2C+Mohamed+M%3BTesfaldet%2C+Yacob+T%3BElmubarak%2C+Marwan+G%3BNaeema+Al+Hosani&isbn=&jtitle=ISPRS+International+Journal+of+Geo-Information&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fijgi11090458","'AYN (United Arab Emirates); Accuracy; Air pollution; Al Ain; Algorithms; Analysis; AREAS; Cities; Classification; Components; Ecological effects; Environmental impact; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; Geographical information systems; Geography; greenness; Image classification; INDIANAPOLIS; Indicators; Infrastructure; International organizations; Land cover; Land surface temperature; LAND surface temperature; Land use; Learning algorithms; machine learning; Machine learning; MACHINE learning; Normalized difference vegetative index; principal component analysis (PCA); Principal components analysis; Public services; Quality; Quality of life; QUALITY of life; remote sensing; Remote sensing; REMOTE sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Savi; Schools; Sociodemographics; Socioeconomics; Soil water; Soils; Support vector machines; Surface temperature; Surfaces; Sustainability; Sustainable city; Sustainable development; United Arab Emirates; UNITED Arab Emirates; Urban; Urban areas; URBAN life; Urban planning; urban quality of life; Urbanism; Urbanization; Variance; Vegetation; WATER INDEX NDWI","⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bioenergy production aligns with several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) directly or indirectly. Bioenergy feedstocks are spatio-temporally distributed and, therefore, design of a green and sustainable Biomass Supply Chain (BSC) is pivotal for effective commercialization of bioenergy. The BSC starts with biomass harvest and includes collection, processing, storage, and transportation as intermediate processes and ends with biomass delivery at the conversion facilities. All these processes are spatially interlinked. Cost-effective bioenergy generation requires an effective and efficient BSC model. The absence of such model is the major cause of failure of bioenergy plants. With this backdrop, this paper reviewed literature related to BSC, and its elements. The elements are then linked with emissions, economy, and socio-cultural aspects to draw a wider picture of bioenergy for sustainable development. The challenges associated with bioenergy are elucidated with in-depth discussion. The analysis shows that green and sustainable BSC can be a major tool to achieve UN SDGs in many ways. On the contrary, present situation of BSC is challenging from multiple perspectives: environmental, socio-cultural, economic, policy, institutional as well as technological challenges. To achieve global deployment of bioenergy with net zero emissions target, use of advanced and emerging tools and techniques like artificial intelligence, machine learning, remote sensing & GIS, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is recommended.","2023-08-01","2024-01-19 11:06:50","2024-01-19 11:10:59","2024-01-19 11:06:50","106893","","","175","","Biomass and Bioenergy","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/N58UA6I3/S0961953423001927.html","","AGRICULTURAL BIOMASS; Bioenergy; Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; BIOMASS; Biomass logistics; Biomass supply chain; CARBON FOOTPRINT; CARBON sequestration; COMMERCIAL-SCALE; CULTURAL landscapes; DRONE aircraft; FOREST BIOMASS; INTEGRATING GIS; INVENTORY MANAGEMENT; Life cycle assessment; LIFE cycles (Biology); NETWORK DESIGN-MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; PRODUCT life cycle assessment; RENEWABLE ENERGY; RICE STRAW; SUPPLY chains; Sustainable bioenergy; UNITED Nations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Landsenses ecology proposes the concepts of physical and psychological perceptions to measure the interaction between humans and the urban environment. However, such perceptions and their quantitative relationships with housing rental prices (HRPs) are still not clear. In this study, a novel urban-perception-oriented hedonic price model (UP-HPM) is proposed based on the construction of a multisource geographic database of Beijing’s rental market with rich information on people-oriented perception metrics, neighborhood environment characteristics, and HRPs. Furthermore, we use advanced machine learning (ML) pipelines to measure residents’ multidimensional urban perceptions and investigate their impact on block-level HRPs and their spatial disparities. We also quantify and compare the contribution of different physical and psychological perceptual attributes to HRPs through UP-HPM. The results show that neighborhood perceived greenery and the use of fences tend to bring about positive psychological perceptions and further affect HRPs. By comparing different combinations of hedonic and perceptual features, the UP-HPM performs well in terms of fitting capacity, spatial description, and interpretability and can inspire humanistic thinking and landsenses planning guidelines for the regulation of the allocation of public rental housing and improvement in block-level physical settings and infrastructure services, thereby providing insights into how best to promote residents’ quality of life and well-being.","2023-11-17","2024-01-19 11:09:05","2024-01-19 11:11:11","2024-01-19 11:09:05","964-980","","8","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2023.2234332","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/YGMNJGQ2/Zhang et al. - 2023 - Understanding the effects of urban perceptions on .pdf","","","housing rental prices; landsenses ecology; machine learning; physical and psychological perceptions; sustainable community","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on semi-arid dwarf mangroves of Baja California Sur, Mexico, where the mangroves tend to be stunted in height and found in small patches, as well as larger forests. Using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro, we imaged mangroves and labeled the extent by manual classification in QGIS. Using ArcGIS, we compared satellite-based mangrove extent maps from Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) in 2016 and Mexico’s national government agency (National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity, CONABIO) in 2015, with extent maps generated from in situ drone studies in 2018 and 2019. We found that satellite-based extent maps generally overestimated mangrove coverage compared to that of drone-based maps. To correct this overestimation, we developed a method to derive correction factors for GMW mangrove extent. These correction factors correspond to specific pixel patterns generated from a convolution analysis and mangrove coverage defined from drone imagery. We validated our model by using repeated k-fold cross-validation, producing an accuracy of 98.3% ± 2.1%. Overall, drones and satellites are complementary tools, and the rise of machine learning can help stakeholders further leverage the strengths of the two tools, to better monitor mangroves for local, national, and international management.","2020-01","2024-01-19 12:18:36","2024-01-19 12:18:36","2024-01-19 12:18:36","3986","","23","12","","","Driven by Drones","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 23 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/X2NFME8H/Hsu et al. - 2020 - Driven by Drones Improving Mangrove Extent Maps U.pdf","","","area correction; convolution; geographic information systems; international commitments; monitoring; unmanned aerial vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Satellite remote sensing has been widely applied to estimate surface soil moisture. However, it is still a challenge to retrieve surface soil moisture content (SMC) data in the heterogeneous catchment at high spatial resolution. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the retrieval of SMC from remote sensing data, which is important in the planning and efficient use of land resources. Many methods based on satellite-derived vegetation indices have already been developed to estimate SMC in various climatic and geographic conditions. Soil moisture retrievals were performed using statistical and machine learning methods as well as physical modeling techniques. In this study, an important experiment of soil moisture retrieval for investigating the capability of the machine learning methods was conducted in the early spring season in a semi-arid region of Iran. We applied random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and elastic net regression (EN) algorithms to soil moisture retrieval by optical and thermal sensors of Landsat 8 and knowledge of land-use types on previously untested conditions in a semi-arid region of Iran. The statistical comparisons show that RF method provided the highest Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency value (0.73) for soil moisture retrieval covered by the different land-use types. Combinations of surface reflectance and auxiliary geospatial data can provide more valuable information for SMC estimation, which shows promise for precision agriculture applications.","2020-11","2024-01-19 12:19:40","2024-01-19 12:19:40","2024-01-19 12:19:40","3223","","11","12","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 11 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/ninaleach/Zotero/storage/EHZZ35IT/Adab et al. - 2020 - Machine Learning to Estimate Surface Soil Moisture.pdf","","","machine learning; remote sensing; semi-arid region of Iran; soil moisture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
