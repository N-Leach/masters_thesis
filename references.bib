            Rigorous evidence is vital in all disciplines to ensure efficient, appropriate, and fit-for-purpose decision-making with minimised risk of unintended harm. To date, however, disciplines have been slow to share evidence synthesis frameworks, best practices, and tools amongst one another. Recent progress in collaborative digital and programmatic frameworks, such as the free and Open Source software R, have significantly expanded the opportunities for development of free-to-use, incrementally improvable, community driven tools to support evidence synthesis (e.g. EviAtlas, robvis, PRISMA2020 flow diagrams and metadat). Despite this, evidence synthesis (and meta-analysis) practitioners and methodologists who make use of R remain relatively disconnected from one another. Here, we report on a new virtual conference for evidence synthesis and meta-analysis in the R programming environment (ESMARConf) that aims to connect these communities. By designing an entirely free and online conference from scratch, we have been able to focus efforts on maximising accessibility and equity—making these core missions for our new community of practice. As a community of practice, ESMARConf builds on the success and groundwork of the broader R community and systematic review coordinating bodies (e.g. Cochrane), but fills an important niche. ESMARConf aims to maximise accessibility and equity of participants across regions, contexts, and social backgrounds, forging a level playing field in a digital, connected, and online future of evidence synthesis. We believe that everyone should have the same access to participation and involvement, and we believe ESMARConf provides a vital opportunity to push for equitability across disciplines, regions, and personal situations.},

              We study recently developed nonparametric methods for estimating the number of missing studies that might exist in a meta‐analysis and the effect that these studies might have had on its outcome. These are simple rank‐based data augmentation techniques, which formalize the use of funnel plots. We show that they provide effective and relatively powerful tests for evaluating the existence of such publication bias. After adjusting for missing studies, we find that the point estimate of the overall effect size is approximately correct and coverage of the effect size confidence intervals is substantially improved, in many cases recovering the nominal confidence levels entirely. We illustrate the trim and fill method on existing meta‐analyses of studies in clinical trials and psychometrics.},

Yet, the search systems allowing access to this evidence provide varying levels of precision, recall, and reproducibility and also demand different levels of effort. To date, it remains unclear which search systems are most appropriate for evidence synthesis and why. Advice on which search engines and bibliographic databases to choose for systematic searches is limited and lacking systematic, empirical performance assessments. This study investigates and compares the systematic search qualities of 28 widely used academic search systems, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science. A novel, query‐based method tests how well users are able to interact and retrieve records with each system. The study is the first to show the extent to which search systems can effectively and efficiently perform (Boolean) searches with regards to precision, recall, and reproducibility. We found substantial differences in the performance of search systems, meaning that their usability in systematic searches varies. Indeed, only half of the search systems analyzed and only a few Open Access databases can be recommended for evidence syntheses without adding substantial caveats. Particularly, our findings demonstrate why Google Scholar is inappropriate as principal search system. We call for database owners to recognize the requirements of evidence synthesis and for academic journals to reassess quality requirements for systematic reviews. Our findings aim to support researchers in conducting better searches for better evidence synthesis.},

	abstract = {Despite their importance to ecosystem services, wetlands are threatened by pollution and development. Over the last few decades, a growing number of wetland studies employed remote sensing (RS) to scientifically monitor the status of wetlands and support their sustainability. Considering the rapid evolution of wetland studies and significant progress that has been made in the field, this paper constitutes an overview of studies utilizing RS methods in wetland monitoring. It investigates publications from 1990 up to the middle of 2022, providing a systematic survey on RS data type, machine learning (ML) tools, publication details (e.g., authors, affiliations, citations, and publications date), case studies, accuracy metrics, and other parameters of interest for RS-based wetland studies by covering 344 papers. The RS data and ML combination is deemed helpful for wetland monitoring and multi-proxy studies, and it may open up new perspectives for research studies. In a rapidly changing wetlands landscape, integrating multiple RS data types and ML algorithms is an opportunity to advance science support for management decisions. This paper provides insight into the selection of suitable ML and RS data types for the detailed monitoring of wetland-associated systems. The synthesized findings of this paper are essential to determining best practices for environmental management, restoration, and conservation of wetlands. This meta-analysis establishes avenues for future research and outlines a baseline framework to facilitate further scientific research using the latest state-of-art ML tools for processing RS data. Overall, the present work recommends that wetland sustainability requires a special land-use policy and relevant protocols, regulation, and/or legislation.},

            This paper concentrates on the different meanings of machine learning (ML) from its origins to the present and potential future, focusing on contributions within the discipline of geography. Understanding the history of ML is important both for understanding current trends and predicting future applications. The 1950s saw the first idea of ML with the Turing Test, which was described as a ‘learning machine’ that could acquire information and become artificially intelligent. This thought prevailed until the 1960s with the release of Perceptron I, which caused a shift to attempt to code computers to learn from input data in order to run like a human brain. The 1980s and 1990s saw the advancement of computing technologies which enabled ML within artificial intelligence to prosper. The development of artificial neural networks during this time shifted ML from a knowledge‐driven approach to a data‐driven one. The 2000s saw ML becoming more widespread within geography and other disciplines as unsupervised methods enabled the analysis of large data sets. More recently, deep learning emerged to enable processes to be integrated into many software services and applications. Present day ML has been defined by Stanford University (2017) as “the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed”. Academic research alongside industry and government investments in ML now account for some of the most important technological advancements. The use of ML within geography has been increasing at a rapid rate paving the way for future advancements in the discipline.},

In this review, we explore the recent articles, providing a thorough classiﬁcation of approaches into three main categories: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, Vision Transformer (ViT)-based, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based architectures. Notably, within the CNN-based category, we further reﬁne the classiﬁcation based on speciﬁc methodologies and techniques employed. In addition, a novel and rigorous meta-analysis is performed to synthesize and analyze the ﬁndings from 50 peer-reviewed journal articles to provide valuable insights in this domain, surpassing the scope of existing review articles. Our meta-analysis shows that the most adopted remote sensing scene datasets are AID (41 articles) and NWPU-RESISC45 (40). A notable paradigm shift is seen towards the use of transformer-based models (6) starting from 2021. Furthermore, we critically discuss the ﬁndings from the review and meta-analysis, identifying challenges and future opportunities for improvement in this domain.

	abstract = {This article reviews the main recent applications of multi-sensor remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence techniques in multivariate modelling of agricultural drought. The study focused mainly on three fundamental aspects, namely descriptive modelling, predictive modelling, and spatial modelling of expected risks and vulnerability to drought. Thus, out of 417 articles across all studies on drought, 226 articles published from 2010 to 2022 were analyzed to provide a global overview of the current state of knowledge on multivariate drought modelling using the inclusion criteria. The main objective is to review the recent available scientific evidence regarding multivariate drought modelling based on the joint use of geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence. The analysis focused on the different methods used, the choice of algorithms and the most relevant variables depending on whether they are descriptive or predictive models. Criteria such as the skill score, the given game complexity used, and the nature of validation data were considered to draw the main conclusions. The results highlight the very heterogeneous nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought, and the very original nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought in the recent literature. For future studies, in addition to scientific advances in prospects, case studies and comparative studies appear necessary for an in-depth analysis of the reproducibility and operational applicability of the different approaches proposed for spatial and temporal modelling of agricultural drought. HIGHLIGHTSThe components and fundamentals of multivariate modelling of agricultural drought were discussed.The importance of hybrid artificial intelligence models is widely discussed in improving the performance of traditional machine learning models.Quantum machine learning algorithms are weakly explored in multivariate drought modelling. Therefore, future studies should explore this approach.The major challenge of multivariate modelling of drought frequency is mainly related to the difference in the return periods of the different variables (time-shifted and spatially effects).},

	abstract = {Quality and reliable drought prediction is essential for mitigation strategies and planning in disaster-stricken regions globally. Prediction models such as empirical or data-driven models play a fundamental role in forecasting drought. However, selecting a suitable prediction model remains a challenge because of the lack of succinct information available on model performance. Therefore, this review evaluated the best model for drought forecasting and determined which differences if any were present in model performance using standardised precipitation index (SPI). In addition, the most effective combination of the SPI with its respective timescale and lead time was investigated. The effectiveness of data-driven models was analysed using meta-regression analysis by applying a linear mixed model to the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error of the validated model results. Wavelet-transformed neural networks had superior performance with the highest correlation and minimum error. Preprocessing data to eliminate non-stationarity performed substantially better than did the regular artificial neural network (ANN) model. Additionally, the best timescale to calculate the SPI was 24 and 12 months and a lead time of 1–3 months provided the most accurate forecasts. Studies from China and Sicily had the most variation based on geographical location as a random effect; while studies from India rendered consistent results overall. Variation in the result can be attributed to geographical differences, seasonal influence, incorporation of climate indices and author bias. Conclusively, this review recommends use of the wavelet-based ANN (WANN) model to forecast drought indices.},

	abstract = {As satellite observation technology develops and the number of Earth observation (EO) satellites increases, satellite observations have become essential to developments in the understanding of the Earth and its environment. However, the current impacts to the remote sensing community of different EO satellite data and possible future trends of EO satellite data applications have not been systematically examined. In this paper, we review the impacts of and future trends in the use of EO satellite data based on an analysis of data from 15 EO satellites whose data are widely used. Articles that reference EO satellite missions included in the Web of Science core collection for 2020 were analyzed using scientometric analysis and meta-analysis. We found the following: (1) the number of publications and citations referencing EO satellites is increasing exponentially; however, the number of articles referencing AVHRR, SPOT, and TerraSAR is tending to decrease; (2) papers related to EO satellites are concentrated in a small number of journals: 43.79\% of the articles that were reviewed were published in only 13 journals; and (3) remote sensing impact factor (RSIF), a new impact index, was constructed to measure the impacts of EO satellites and to predict future trends in applications of their data. Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, Gaofen, and WorldView were found to be the most significant current EO satellite missions and MODIS data to have the widest range of applications. Over the next five years (2021–2025), it is expected that Sentinel will become the satellite mission with the greatest influence.},

	abstract = {Classification of remotely sensed imagery for land-cover mapping purposes has attracted significant attention from researchers and practitioners. Numerous studies conducted over several decades have investigated a broad array of input data and classification methods. However, this vast assemblage of research results has not been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the relative performance of different classification processes for generating land cover products. To address this problem, we completed a statistical meta-analysis of the past 15years of research on supervised per-pixel image classification published in five high-impact remote sensing journals. The two general factors evaluated were classification algorithms and input data manipulation as these are factors that can be controlled by analysts to improve classification accuracy. The meta-analysis revealed that inclusion of texture information yielded the greatest improvement in overall accuracy of land-cover classification with an average increase of 12.1\%. This increase in accuracy can be attributed to the additional spatial context information provided by including texture. Inclusion of ancillary data, multi-angle and time images also provided significant improvement in classification overall accuracy, with 8.5\%, 8.0\%, and 6.9\% of average improvements, respectively. In contrast, other manipulation of spectral information such as index creation (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and feature extraction (e.g. Principal Components Analysis) offered much smaller improvements in accuracy. In terms of classification algorithms, support vector machines achieved the greatest accuracy, followed by neural network methods. The random forest classifier performed considerably better than the traditional decision tree classifier. Maximum likelihood classifiers, often used as benchmarking algorithms, offered low accuracy. Our findings will help guide practitioners to decide which classification to implement and also provide direction to researchers regarding comparative studies that will further solidify our understanding of different classification processes. However, these general guidelines do not preclude an analyst from incorporating personal preferences or considering specific algorithmic benefits that may be pertinent to a particular application.},

Poverty data, for example, is typically scarce, sparse in coverage, and labor-intensive to obtain. Remote sensing data such as high-resolution satellite imagery, on the other hand, is becoming increasingly available and inexpensive. Unfortunately, such data is highly unstructured and currently no techniques exist to automatically extract useful insights to inform policy decisions and help direct humanitarian efforts. We propose a novel machine learning approach to extract large-scale socioeconomic indicators from high-resolution satellite imagery. The main challenge is that training data is very scarce, making it difficult to apply modern techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We therefore propose a transfer learning approach where nighttime light intensities are used as a data-rich proxy. We train a fully convolutional CNN model to predict nighttime lights from daytime imagery, simultaneously learning features that are useful for poverty prediction. The model learns filters identifying different terrains and man-made structures, including roads, buildings, and farmlands, without any supervision beyond nighttime lights. We demonstrate that these learned features are highly informative for poverty mapping, even approaching the predictive performance of survey data collected in the field.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The challenges of Reproducibility and Replicability (R \& R) in computer science experiments have become a focus of attention in the last decade, as efforts to adhere to good research practices have increased. However, experiments using Deep Learning (DL) remain difficult to reproduce due to the complexity of the techniques used. Challenges such as estimating poverty indicators (e.g., wealth index levels) from remote sensing imagery, requiring the use of huge volumes of data across different geographic locations, would be impossible without the use of DL technology. To test the reproducibility of DL experiments, we report a review of the reproducibility of three DL experiments which analyze visual indicators from satellite and street imagery. For each experiment, we identify the challenges found in the data sets, methods and workflows used. As a result of this assessment we propose a checklist incorporating relevant FAIR principles to screen an experiment for its reproducibility. Based on the lessons learned from this study, we recommend a set of actions aimed to improve the reproducibility of such experiments and reduce the likelihood of wasted effort. We believe that the target audience is broad, from researchers seeking to reproduce an experiment, authors reporting an experiment, or reviewers seeking to assess the work of others.

            Plain Language Summary
            This paper aims to help researchers understand the challenges of reproducing Deep Learning (DL) publications, mitigate reproducibility gaps, and make their own work more reproducible. We build on the work of others and add recommendations organized by (a) the quality of the data set (and associated metadata), (b) the DL methodology, (c) the implementation methodology, and the infrastructure used. To our knowledge, this is the first initiative of its kind to address the problem of reproducibility in remote sensing imagery and DL problems for real‐world tasks. We hope this paper lowers the barrier to entry for the DL community to improve research. Following the lifecycle mantra: reproduce!, then replicate! With the goal of improving reproducibility!

	abstract = {With limited time to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world needs effective, scalable approaches to measure and monitor global progress toward the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Given that many SDGs are closely related to the environment in which people live, satellite data are commonly used for SDG assessment, but they are only based on a top-down view and have inherent technical issues (e.g., insufficient spatial resolution and cloud coverage). In recent years, street view imagery (SVI), as an emerging source of remote sensing data, has been an indispensable supplement to monitor SDGs, by recording the environment from an eye-level view. However, the systematic and comprehensive understanding of SVI applications to promote SDGs is insufficient. We reviewed SVI-related studies of SDGs and found that SVI is mainly used for good health and well-being (SDG 3), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), zero hunger (SDG 2), and climate action (SDG 13). The SVI-based greenery view index was the most common element feature related to SDGs. The SVIderived human perception features were also often used to assess SDG 3 and SDG 11. Future studies may further investigate the potential mechanisms between SVI-based features and SDGs. This review provides a compre­ hensive summary and guidance for governments and scholars worldwide to assess SDGs based on SVI in the future.},
